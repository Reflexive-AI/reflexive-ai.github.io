<p>In the 1970s, aviation was dangerous. Accidents were common, and the industry lacked systematic ways to learn from them. Pilots who made mistakes faced punishment, so they hid errors. The same failures recurred because no one knew they had happened before.</p>
<p>Then aviation developed something revolutionary: confidential incident reporting systems that prioritized learning over blame. Today, aviation is the safest form of travel, and its safety culture—built on systematic incident reporting, analysis, and sharing—is credited as a major reason.</p>
<p>AI governance faces an analogous challenge. Harmful AI incidents occur, but we lack systematic mechanisms to report them, analyze them, and ensure the entire field learns from them. Aviation’s experience offers lessons for building such mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="why-incident-reporting-matters">Why Incident Reporting Matters</h2>
<p>The goal of incident reporting is not punishment but learning. Every incident, near-miss, and anomaly contains information about how systems can fail. Capturing this information and making it available to others who might face similar situations is essential for improving safety over time.</p>
<p>Without systematic reporting, failures are isolated events. Each organization learns only from its own mistakes—and often doesn’t even learn from those, because individuals hide errors to avoid consequences. The same failures repeat across organizations and over time.</p>
<p>With systematic reporting, failures become shared knowledge. An organization encountering a novel problem can check whether others have faced it. Patterns across many incidents reveal systemic issues that wouldn’t be visible from any single event. The entire field learns from each organization’s experience.</p>
<p>This is particularly valuable in AI, where we are still in early stages of understanding how systems fail. The patterns that emerge from aggregating many incidents could reveal failure modes no one has yet anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-aviation-reporting">Key Features of Aviation Reporting</h2>
<p>Several features make aviation incident reporting effective. Each has implications for AI.</p>
<h3 id="confidentiality-and-non-punishment">Confidentiality and Non-Punishment</h3>
<p>The NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) guarantees confidentiality to reporters. Reports are de-identified before analysis and sharing. And critically, filing a report provides limited immunity from punishment for the reported incident.</p>
<p>This trade-off—accepting that some errors will go unpunished in exchange for the learning that comes from reporting—was controversial initially. But it proved essential. Pilots began reporting errors they would otherwise have hidden. The volume and quality of reports increased dramatically.</p>
<p>AI incident reporting faces the same challenge. Organizations have strong incentives to hide harmful incidents: legal liability, reputational damage, and competitive disadvantage. Without protections, most incidents will go unreported.</p>
<p>Designing appropriate protections is complex. Complete immunity would eliminate accountability. No protection would eliminate reporting. The aviation model offers a middle path: limited protections for good-faith reports, with serious violations still subject to enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="separation-from-enforcement">Separation from Enforcement</h3>
<p>Aviation reporting systems are typically operated by entities separate from the regulators who enforce rules. NASA operates ASRS, not the FAA. This separation is critical for trust—reporters believe their information won’t be used against them.</p>
<p>AI incident reporting would benefit from similar separation. If the same agency that investigates violations also receives voluntary reports, organizations will hesitate to report. An independent entity—perhaps a non-governmental organization or a separate government office with strong firewalls—might generate more trust and more reports.</p>
<h3 id="structured-data-collection">Structured Data Collection</h3>
<p>Aviation reports use standardized formats that capture essential information: what happened, when, where, what equipment was involved, what conditions existed, what the reporter believes caused the incident.</p>
<p>Standardization enables analysis across reports. Patterns become visible when data is consistent. Ad hoc narratives, while valuable for context, are hard to aggregate.</p>
<p>AI incident reporting would benefit from similar structure. A standardized schema for AI incidents might capture: the system involved (with capability characterization), the deployment context, the harm that occurred, the apparent cause, any mitigation that was attempted. This connects to our work on <a href="/research/003-machine-readable-constraint-schema/">machine-readable constraint schemas</a>—structured formats that enable computational analysis.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-and-dissemination">Analysis and Dissemination</h3>
<p>Collecting reports is useless without analysis and sharing. Aviation systems employ analysts who review reports, identify patterns, and produce safety alerts and recommendations.</p>
<p>These outputs are widely disseminated. Airlines, pilots, manufacturers, and regulators all receive relevant findings. Safety improvements from one organization’s incident benefit the entire industry.</p>
<p>AI would benefit from similar analysis and sharing mechanisms. An entity that aggregates AI incidents, identifies patterns, and disseminates findings could accelerate learning across the field. This is particularly valuable for organizations without the resources to conduct extensive safety research themselves.</p>
<h2 id="adapting-to-ai">Adapting to AI</h2>
<p>Aviation lessons provide direction, but AI has distinctive features that require adaptation.</p>
<h3 id="speed-and-volume">Speed and Volume</h3>
<p>Aviation incidents are relatively rare events that occur over extended time periods. AI systems make millions of decisions per second, and harmful outputs can occur continuously.</p>
<p>AI incident reporting must address scale. Not every problematic output can be individually reported. Some combination of automated detection (flagging outputs that meet certain criteria), sampling (reporting representative incidents rather than all of them), and threshold-based reporting (mandatory reports for serious incidents, voluntary for minor ones) will be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="attribution-complexity">Attribution Complexity</h3>
<p>When an aircraft fails, the aircraft, its operator, and the conditions are typically identifiable. When an AI system produces harmful output, attribution is more complex: the same model might be deployed in many contexts, modified by downstream users, and triggered by user inputs that vary enormously.</p>
<p>AI incident reports need to capture enough context to enable meaningful analysis. This includes not just the model identity but the deployment context, the input that triggered the output, any modifications or fine-tuning applied, and the interaction history if relevant.</p>
<h3 id="competitive-dynamics">Competitive Dynamics</h3>
<p>Aviation incident reporting benefits from the fact that airlines are not primarily competing on safety claims. They use the same aircraft, similar procedures, and shared safety information without competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>AI developers compete partly on safety. Admitting to harmful incidents might benefit competitors. This competitive dynamic could suppress reporting even with confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Addressing this might require either mandatory reporting (removing the competitive choice) or industry-wide participation commitments that ensure no single organization is disadvantaged by reporting.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-evolution">Rapid Evolution</h3>
<p>Aircraft designs change over decades. AI capabilities change over months. Incident patterns from a year ago might be irrelevant to current systems.</p>
<p>AI incident analysis must be faster than aviation analysis, and findings must be disseminated more quickly to remain useful. This might require automated analysis tools that can identify patterns in real time, supplemented by human review.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-reflexive-governance">Connecting to Reflexive Governance</h2>
<p>Incident reporting is particularly relevant to reflexive AI governance. AI systems might themselves participate in incident detection and reporting.</p>
<p>A system that monitors its own outputs and flags potential harms contributes to incident detection. We explored this in <a href="/research/011-reflexive-misuse-detection/">can AI systems detect their own misuse</a>. Such self-monitoring could feed into incident reporting systems automatically.</p>
<p>Similarly, our work on <a href="/research/014-ai-regulator-protocol/">protocols for AI-to-regulator communication</a> envisions AI systems that can directly report concerns to oversight bodies. This creates a pathway for real-time incident reporting that doesn’t depend on human operators noticing and choosing to report.</p>
<p>The combination of human and AI reporting could capture incidents that either alone would miss. Humans notice harms that systems don’t recognize; systems notice patterns that humans overlook.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-steps">Implementation Steps</h2>
<p>Moving toward effective AI incident reporting requires concrete steps.</p>
<p><strong>Establish an independent reporting entity.</strong> This entity would receive reports, maintain confidentiality, conduct analysis, and disseminate findings. Independence from both industry and enforcement is critical for trust.</p>
<p><strong>Develop standardized reporting formats.</strong> What information must every report contain? What optional information is valuable? Standards enable aggregation and analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Create appropriate protections.</strong> Reporters need confidence that good-faith reports won’t be used against them. This requires legal protections that balance learning against accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Build analysis capacity.</strong> The entity needs resources to analyze reports, identify patterns, and produce actionable findings. This requires both human expertise and computational tools.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure dissemination.</strong> Findings are useless if they don’t reach those who can act on them. Channels for sharing lessons across the industry must be established.</p>
<p><strong>Integrate with AI systems.</strong> As reflexive mechanisms mature, AI systems should be able to contribute to incident reporting directly, flagging potential harms in real time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Aviation’s incident reporting systems represent decades of learning about how to build safety culture in a complex technical domain. AI governance can benefit from this experience while adapting to AI’s distinctive features.</p>
<p>The core insight is that learning requires information, and information requires trust. Creating systems that organizations trust enough to report honestly is the foundation of collective learning about AI safety.</p>
<p>This is not a complete solution to AI governance—incident reporting addresses learning but not prevention. But learning from incidents is essential for preventing future ones. Aviation’s transformation from dangerous to safe offers hope that AI governance can achieve similar progress.</p>
