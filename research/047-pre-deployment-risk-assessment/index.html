Pre-deployment risk assessment aims to identify problems while they can still be prevented rather than merely managed. This analysis examines frameworks that structure this critical evaluation phase.</p>
<h2 id="the-pre-deployment-window">The Pre-Deployment Window</h2>
<p>The period between completing development and releasing a system represents the last opportunity for intervention without real-world consequences. Once deployed, AI systems generate user dependencies, business commitments, and social adaptations that make withdrawal costly. The pre-deployment window is precious.</p>
<p>Yet this window often gets compressed. Development timelines slip; launch dates remain fixed. Competitive pressure accelerates release. Assessment becomes rushed, incomplete, or performative. Frameworks that work in theory fail when time constraints bind.</p>
<p>Effective pre-deployment assessment must therefore be designed for realistic conditions—not ideal ones. This means parallel rather than sequential processes, tiered approaches calibrated to risk levels, and clear criteria for minimum viable assessment.</p>
<h2 id="risk-taxonomy">Risk Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Any assessment framework requires a classification of risks to examine. Taxonomies vary, but useful categories include:</p>
<p><strong>Technical risks</strong>: Model failure modes, accuracy degradation, adversarial vulnerabilities, distributional shift sensitivity, scaling behaviors, emergent capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment risks</strong>: Human-AI interaction failures, automation bias, skill degradation, integration problems, gaming and manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Social risks</strong>: Differential impacts across groups, power concentration, dependency creation, market effects, norm shifts.</p>
<p><strong>Security risks</strong>: Model theft, data extraction, misuse potential, dual-use applications.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic risks</strong>: Correlated failures across systems, infrastructure dependencies, irreversibility of outcomes.</p>
<p>No single assessment can examine all risks at maximum depth. <a href="/research/046-algorithmic-impact-assessments/">Algorithmic impact assessments</a> provide comprehensive frameworks; pre-deployment assessment focuses on the subset most relevant to release decisions.</p>
<h2 id="tiered-assessment-design">Tiered Assessment Design</h2>
<p>Not all systems require equivalent scrutiny. A text-to-emoji converter doesn’t need the same evaluation as a medical diagnosis system. Tiered frameworks calibrate effort to stakes.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Minimal assessment</strong> for low-stakes applications. Automated checks for basic safety properties, spot-testing of failure modes, compliance verification. Days rather than weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Standard assessment</strong> for moderate-stakes applications. Systematic evaluation against defined criteria, red team exercises, bias audits, documentation review. Weeks of effort.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3: Enhanced assessment</strong> for high-stakes applications. Comprehensive technical evaluation, external review, stakeholder consultation, scenario analysis, staged deployment planning. Months of preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 4: Maximal assessment</strong> for transformative capabilities. Multi-stakeholder governance, extended evaluation periods, third-party audits, contingency planning, phased release with monitoring. <a href="/research/031-understanding-frontier-ai/">Frontier AI systems</a> typically require this level.</p>
<p>The criteria for tier assignment should be explicit. Factors include: affected population size, reversibility of harms, vulnerability of affected populations, decision stakes, system autonomy level, and presence of human oversight.</p>
<h2 id="technical-evaluation-components">Technical Evaluation Components</h2>
<p>Technical assessment examines model behavior across relevant conditions. Core components include:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy characterization</strong>: Not just aggregate metrics but performance distribution across relevant subgroups, input variations, and edge cases. Systems often fail in patterns invisible to overall statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty quantification</strong>: Does the model know what it doesn’t know? Calibration assessment measures whether confidence correlates with accuracy. Systems that are confidently wrong pose greater risks than those that express uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Robustness testing</strong>: How does performance change under input perturbations, distribution shifts, or adversarial attacks? <a href="/research/050-red-teaming-methodologies/">Red teaming methodologies</a> systematically probe vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Failure mode analysis</strong>: What happens when the system fails? Graceful degradation is safer than catastrophic failure. Systems should fail in ways that enable human intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral boundaries</strong>: Does the system produce outputs outside acceptable ranges? Boundary testing verifies that dangerous, unethical, or unauthorized behaviors are constrained.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-context-assessment">Deployment Context Assessment</h2>
<p>Technical properties alone don’t determine real-world outcomes. Deployment context matters enormously. A model that performs well in controlled testing may fail when deployed in realistic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>User population analysis</strong>: Who will actually use the system, and do their characteristics match training assumptions? Mismatch between assumed and actual users is a common failure mode.</p>
<p><strong>Decision workflow integration</strong>: How does the system fit into existing processes? What happens when it disagrees with human judgment? Will humans actually review AI recommendations, or will automation bias prevail?</p>
<p><strong>Recourse availability</strong>: What options do affected individuals have if the system produces harmful outputs? Systems without meaningful recourse mechanisms require higher scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring capabilities</strong>: What information will be available post-deployment to detect problems? Systems that deploy into black boxes—without visibility into real-world performance—require more extensive pre-deployment evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="scenario-based-assessment">Scenario-Based Assessment</h2>
<p>Scenarios explore possible futures systematically. Rather than attempting to predict specific outcomes, scenario analysis identifies conditions under which risks materialize and assesses preparedness.</p>
<p><strong>Nominal scenarios</strong>: Expected use by typical users under normal conditions. The baseline against which others are compared.</p>
<p><strong>Stress scenarios</strong>: High-load conditions, unusual inputs, edge cases. How does the system behave at extremes?</p>
<p><strong>Adversarial scenarios</strong>: Intentional manipulation by sophisticated actors. <a href="/research/035-dual-use-biology/">Dual-use concerns</a> are explored here.</p>
<p><strong>Failure scenarios</strong>: What if the system fails? What if monitoring fails? What if remediation fails? Cascading failure analysis identifies single points of catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>Change scenarios</strong>: How might the system’s environment evolve? Regulatory changes, user adaptation, competitive responses, technological developments. <a href="/research/009-capability-overhang/">Capability overhang</a> considers latent potentials.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-criteria-and-thresholds">Assessment Criteria and Thresholds</h2>
<p>Assessment generates evidence, but deployment decisions require criteria for interpreting that evidence. What level of risk is acceptable? What failure rate triggers delay?</p>
<p>Explicit thresholds force difficult conversations before they’re complicated by sunk costs and launch pressure. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“No deployment if accuracy for protected groups falls below 80% of overall accuracy”</li>
<li>“Delay if red team identifies jailbreaks achievable in fewer than 10 attempts”</li>
<li>“External review required before deploying systems with dual-use potential”</li>
</ul>
<p>These thresholds should be set in advance by appropriate authority—not by assessment teams facing deadline pressure, not by product managers with commercial incentives. <a href="/research/042-corporate-governance/">Corporate governance structures</a> establish who sets thresholds and who can grant exceptions.</p>
<h2 id="external-review-integration">External Review Integration</h2>
<p>Internal assessment has inherent limitations: organizational blind spots, incentive conflicts, knowledge gaps. External review provides independent perspective and specialized expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party auditors</strong>: Organizations specializing in AI evaluation bring comparative knowledge across systems and contexts. <a href="/research/006-meta-governance-auditors/">Auditor governance</a> considers how to ensure auditor quality and independence.</p>
<p><strong>Academic collaboration</strong>: Researchers can conduct deeper technical evaluation, though academic timelines may not match commercial needs.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory preview</strong>: Some frameworks enable pre-deployment consultation with regulators, establishing expectations before formal compliance assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Bug bounty programs</strong>: Structured external testing incentivizes discovery of vulnerabilities that internal teams missed.</p>
<p>Integration of external review requires planning for information sharing, timeline coordination, and incorporation of findings. Rushed external review provides limited value.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-requirements">Documentation Requirements</h2>
<p>Assessment activities generate documentation that serves multiple purposes: supporting deployment decisions, enabling future audit, satisfying regulatory requirements, and facilitating organizational learning.</p>
<p>Core documentation elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment scope and methodology</strong>: What was examined and how</li>
<li><strong>Key findings</strong>: What risks were identified and their severity</li>
<li><strong>Mitigation measures</strong>: What changes were made in response</li>
<li><strong>Residual risks</strong>: What risks remain and why they’re acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Assumptions and limitations</strong>: What the assessment didn’t or couldn’t examine</li>
<li><strong>Decision record</strong>: Who approved deployment and on what basis</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation should be retained beyond the system’s operational lifetime—regulatory investigations and liability proceedings may occur years later.</p>
<h2 id="assessment-timing-and-iteration">Assessment Timing and Iteration</h2>
<p>When should assessment occur? Too early misses changes made during final development. Too late compresses the window for remediation. The answer: iterative assessment throughout development, with comprehensive evaluation before release.</p>
<p>Stage gates provide natural assessment points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture review</strong>: Before significant development investment</li>
<li><strong>Data review</strong>: Before training on final datasets</li>
<li><strong>Model evaluation</strong>: After training, before integration</li>
<li><strong>Integration testing</strong>: After integration, before staging</li>
<li><strong>Pre-release assessment</strong>: Final comprehensive evaluation</li>
<li><strong>Post-release monitoring</strong>: Ongoing after deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each gate should have defined criteria, responsible parties, and escalation procedures. Failing a gate should trigger defined processes rather than ad hoc negotiation.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-assessment-for-urgent-situations">Rapid Assessment for Urgent Situations</h2>
<p>Standard frameworks assume adequate time. Reality sometimes differs. Security vulnerabilities require patches now. Competitive dynamics accelerate timelines. What constitutes responsible assessment when time is severely constrained?</p>
<p>Minimum viable assessment focuses on blocking issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety-critical checks</strong>: Will deployment cause immediate harm?</li>
<li><strong>Compliance verification</strong>: Does deployment violate legal requirements?</li>
<li><strong>Known vulnerability screening</strong>: Do established failure modes apply?</li>
<li><strong>Rollback planning</strong>: Can deployment be reversed if problems emerge?</li>
</ol>
<p>Compressed assessment accepts more post-deployment risk. This tradeoff should be explicit: “We’re deploying with reduced pre-deployment assessment because [reason], accepting increased monitoring burden and earlier rollback triggers.”</p>
<h2 id="organizational-requirements">Organizational Requirements</h2>
<p>Effective pre-deployment assessment requires organizational infrastructure beyond the assessment process itself.</p>
<p><strong>Authority</strong>: Assessment teams need power to delay or block deployment. Without authority, assessment becomes advice, easily overridden.</p>
<p><strong>Independence</strong>: Assessors shouldn’t report to deployment-focused managers. Some organizational distance enables honest evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Assessment requires time, expertise, and tooling. Under-resourced assessment produces superficial results.</p>
<p><strong>Escalation paths</strong>: When assessment identifies serious concerns, clear routes to executive decision-making enable appropriate response. <a href="/research/043-board-oversight/">Board-level oversight</a> provides ultimate escalation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pre-deployment risk assessment is the last systematic opportunity to prevent harm before it occurs. Effective frameworks combine comprehensive risk identification with practical constraints, tiered approaches with clear thresholds, internal evaluation with external review.</p>
<p>The frameworks presented here demand organizational commitment—not just process documents but genuine authority, resources, and accountability. Organizations that treat assessment as an obstacle to deployment will conduct assessments that don’t prevent problems. Those that treat assessment as a mechanism for building better systems will discover issues while they can still be addressed.</p>
<p>Time pressure and competitive dynamics work against thorough assessment. But the consequences of inadequate assessment—user harm, regulatory action, reputational damage, liability exposure—argue for taking the pre-deployment window seriously. Assessment isn’t a delay in reaching deployment; it’s a step in doing deployment well.</p>
