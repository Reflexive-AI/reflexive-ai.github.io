<p>A hiring algorithm systematically discriminates against protected groups. An autonomous vehicle causes a fatal accident. A medical AI provides a diagnosis that leads to delayed treatment. A language model assists someone in planning a harmful act.</p>
<p>In each case, a fundamental question arises: who is legally responsible?</p>
<p>Traditional liability frameworks assign responsibility to entities that cause harm through negligent or intentional action. But AI systems complicate this framework in ways that create accountability gaps—situations where genuine harm occurs but no entity faces meaningful liability.</p>
<p>Understanding these gaps is essential for designing governance mechanisms that ensure AI development proceeds with appropriate incentives for safety.</p>
<h2 id="why-ai-breaks-liability">Why AI Breaks Liability</h2>
<p>Several features of AI systems challenge existing liability doctrines.</p>
<h3 id="distributed-causation">Distributed Causation</h3>
<p>A harmful AI outcome typically results from multiple contributing factors: the training data (collected by one party), the model architecture (designed by another), the training process (configured by engineers), the deployment context (chosen by a deployer), and the user’s input (provided by someone else entirely).</p>
<p>When causation is this distributed, it’s unclear which party—if any—bears legal responsibility. Each can point to others in the chain. The data provider didn’t build the model; the model developer didn’t deploy it; the deployer didn’t provide the harmful prompt.</p>
<p>Traditional products liability focuses on manufacturers, but the “manufacturer” of an AI outcome might be many entities or none of them in the classical sense.</p>
<h3 id="opacity">Opacity</h3>
<p>Liability often requires showing that a specific decision or defect caused the harm. For many AI systems, this showing is difficult or impossible. The system’s decision process is not transparent, and even its developers may not be able to explain why a particular output occurred.</p>
<p>This “black box” quality makes it hard to prove the causal chain necessary for liability. Even if we know the AI system was involved, we may not be able to show that a specific design choice, training decision, or operational parameter was the cause of the harm.</p>
<h3 id="emergent-behavior">Emergent Behavior</h3>
<p>AI systems sometimes exhibit behaviors that were not intended, anticipated, or tested for. A capability might emerge from scale or from unexpected interactions between components. Harm resulting from such emergent behavior is difficult to attribute to negligence, because the behavior was not foreseeable by reasonable standards.</p>
<p>This connects to what we explored in <a href="/research/009-capability-overhang/">the capability overhang problem</a>—capabilities that exist but haven’t been documented or tested present liability challenges because they weren’t known to anyone who might be held responsible.</p>
<h3 id="autonomous-action">Autonomous Action</h3>
<p>As AI systems become more autonomous—making decisions without direct human oversight—the connection between human choices and harmful outcomes becomes more attenuated. Strict liability for autonomous systems might assign responsibility regardless of fault, but this raises questions about how to calibrate damages and whether such liability would chill beneficial innovation.</p>
<h2 id="current-approaches-and-their-limits">Current Approaches and Their Limits</h2>
<p>Existing liability frameworks were not designed for AI and fit imperfectly.</p>
<h3 id="negligence">Negligence</h3>
<p>Under negligence principles, a party is liable if they failed to exercise reasonable care and that failure caused harm. Applied to AI, this might mean liability for developers who failed to test adequately, deployers who used systems in inappropriate contexts, or operators who ignored warning signs.</p>
<p>The challenge is defining “reasonable care” for cutting-edge AI systems. What testing is sufficient? Which deployment contexts are appropriate? What warning signs should have been recognized? These standards are evolving, and courts may lack the technical expertise to establish them.</p>
<p>Additionally, proving that a specific failure of care caused the harm requires understanding the AI’s decision process—often impossible given opacity.</p>
<h3 id="products-liability">Products Liability</h3>
<p>Products liability holds manufacturers responsible for defective products regardless of negligence. This might seem applicable to AI, but several difficulties arise.</p>
<p>Is an AI system a “product” at all? Services are typically governed by different rules. A cloud-based AI accessed via API might be classified as a service rather than a product, potentially escaping products liability.</p>
<p>What constitutes a “defect” in an AI system? An output that causes harm is not necessarily defective—the system might be working as designed while producing rare but foreseeable errors. Or the output might result from the user’s input rather than any flaw in the system.</p>
<h3 id="vicarious-liability">Vicarious Liability</h3>
<p>Employers are liable for harm caused by employees acting within their duties. If AI systems are analogized to employees—or, more precisely, to agents acting on behalf of a principal—developers or deployers might bear vicarious liability for AI actions.</p>
<p>This analogy is strained. AI systems are not legal persons and cannot form intentions. But the underlying logic—that entities who benefit from another’s actions should bear responsibility for the harms those actions cause—might support extending vicarious liability principles.</p>
<h2 id="toward-better-frameworks">Toward Better Frameworks</h2>
<p>Several approaches might address current gaps.</p>
<h3 id="strict-liability-for-high-risk-ai">Strict Liability for High-Risk AI</h3>
<p>One approach imposes strict liability on deployers of high-risk AI systems—liability without requiring proof of fault. This creates strong incentives for safety because deployers bear consequences regardless of whether they were negligent.</p>
<p>The EU has moved in this direction with its AI Liability Directive, which creates presumptions of causation for high-risk systems and eases the burden of proof for claimants.</p>
<p>The trade-off is potential over-deterrence. If liability is too strict, beneficial high-risk applications (medical AI, for instance) might not be deployed even when their expected benefits exceed their expected harms.</p>
<h3 id="mandatory-insurance">Mandatory Insurance</h3>
<p>Requiring AI deployers to carry liability insurance creates several benefits. Insurance companies have incentives to assess and price risk accurately, creating market pressure for safety. Premiums reflect risk levels, providing price signals that guide deployment decisions. And harm victims have a guaranteed source of compensation even if the deployer becomes insolvent.</p>
<p>The challenge is that insurers may lack the ability to assess AI risks, leading to premiums that are either too high (deterring beneficial use) or too low (failing to reflect true risk). As we discussed in <a href="/research/010-self-reporting-vs-audit/">self-reporting vs. external audit</a>, assessing AI capabilities and risks is technically difficult even for specialists.</p>
<h3 id="compensation-funds">Compensation Funds</h3>
<p>Rather than assigning liability to specific parties, some proposals create industry-wide compensation funds—pools of money contributed by AI developers that pay out to victims of AI harms regardless of which specific system or company was responsible.</p>
<p>This ensures compensation even when attribution is impossible but weakens the incentive for individual companies to prioritize safety, since the costs of harm are distributed across the industry.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-and-audit-requirements">Documentation and Audit Requirements</h3>
<p>Liability frameworks work better when the information needed to establish responsibility is available. Requirements to document AI development processes, to log system operations, and to enable post-hoc analysis of decisions make it possible to trace causation and assign responsibility.</p>
<p>Our work on <a href="/research/003-machine-readable-constraint-schema/">machine-readable constraint schemas</a> and <a href="/research/012-output-provenance/">output provenance tagging</a> supports this approach—creating structured records that can be used to understand what happened when harm occurs.</p>
<h3 id="supply-chain-liability">Supply Chain Liability</h3>
<p>When harm results from the interaction of multiple parties in an AI supply chain, allocation of liability among them becomes critical. Clear rules about how liability flows through supply chains—from foundation model developers to fine-tuners to deployers to users—reduce uncertainty and ensure incentives for safety at each level.</p>
<p>This is particularly important for the open-weight model ecosystem, where the relationship between original developers and downstream users is attenuated. We explored related issues in <a href="/research/002-open-weight-safety-paradox/">the open weight safety paradox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h2>
<p>Several principles should guide AI liability framework design.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure compensation.</strong> Victims of AI harms should have access to compensation. Liability frameworks that leave victims without recourse are not just unjust but undermine public trust in AI deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Create safety incentives.</strong> Liability should incentivize appropriate care. If entities that cut corners on safety pay costs when harms occur, they’ll invest more in prevention. If liability is impossible to assign or damages are capped too low, the incentive disappears.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid over-deterrence.</strong> Liability frameworks should not deter beneficial AI deployment. If the expected legal exposure from an AI application exceeds its expected benefits, it won’t be deployed even if its true benefit-to-harm ratio is favorable.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain feasibility.</strong> Liability frameworks must be administrable. If proving causation or assessing damages is impossible in practice, the framework provides no real accountability regardless of its theoretical design.</p>
<p><strong>Adapt to change.</strong> AI capabilities and deployment patterns evolve rapidly. Liability frameworks should be flexible enough to remain applicable as the technology changes, avoiding rules that become obsolete or create perverse incentives as AI advances.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Liability is a critical component of AI governance. When harm occurs, there must be accountability—both to provide justice to those harmed and to create incentives for preventing future harm.</p>
<p>Current frameworks are inadequate, but the path to better frameworks is becoming clear: some combination of strict liability for high-risk applications, mandatory insurance, documentation requirements that enable attribution, and clear supply chain allocation rules.</p>
<p>Getting this right matters not just for victims of AI harms but for the legitimacy of AI deployment broadly. A technology that causes harm without accountability will—and should—face public resistance. Effective liability frameworks help ensure that the benefits of AI can be realized while those who are harmed receive compensation and those who cause harm bear appropriate consequences.</p>
