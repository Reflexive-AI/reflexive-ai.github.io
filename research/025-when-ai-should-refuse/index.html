<p>AI systems are designed to be helpful. They’re trained to fulfill requests, answer questions, and assist with tasks. But not every request should be fulfilled.</p>
<p>When a user asks for help synthesizing a dangerous pathogen, the system should refuse. When asked to generate child sexual abuse material, it should refuse absolutely. But what about borderline cases? What about requests that are harmful in some contexts but legitimate in others?</p>
<p>This analysis develops a principled framework for AI refusals—distinguishing between different types of refusals, specifying when each is appropriate, and addressing the implementation challenges.</p>
<h2 id="the-current-landscape">The Current Landscape</h2>
<p>Current AI systems refuse requests based on training (RLHF to avoid certain outputs) and filters (hard blocks on specific content). These mechanisms often lack transparency about why refusals occur and consistency about when they apply.</p>
<p>Users experience frustration when legitimate requests are refused. Researchers can’t access information about dangerous phenomena they need to study. At the same time, adversarial users find ways around refusals through prompt manipulation. The refusal boundary is simultaneously too restrictive (blocking legitimate use) and too permeable (allowing harmful use through creative prompting).</p>
<p>Part of the problem is the absence of a principled framework. Refusals are implemented through accumulated training examples and ad hoc filters rather than explicit, justified categories. This produces inconsistency and makes improvement difficult.</p>
<h2 id="a-tiered-framework">A Tiered Framework</h2>
<p>We propose organizing refusals into four tiers, each with different justification, implementation, and user experience.</p>
<h3 id="tier-1-absolute-prohibitions">Tier 1: Absolute Prohibitions</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Requests that must never be fulfilled under any circumstances, for any user, in any context.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Detailed instructions for creating weapons of mass destruction, generation of child sexual abuse material, creation of specific cyber weapons targeting critical infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> The potential harm so vastly exceeds any possible legitimate use that no amount of context or user credential can justify fulfillment. These are the <a href="/research/004-red-lines-taxonomy/">red lines</a> that define the outer boundary of acceptable AI behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Hard-coded filters that operate before and after model inference. Not trained through RLHF, which can be manipulated. The model should never produce this content regardless of prompting technique.</p>
<p><strong>User Experience:</strong> Refusal should be clear and unmistakable. The system should explain that this is a categorical prohibition, not a contextual judgment. No workarounds should be offered.</p>
<h3 id="tier-2-context-dependent-refusals">Tier 2: Context-Dependent Refusals</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Requests that are harmful in most contexts but legitimate in some.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Detailed information about pathogen characteristics (harmful for misuse, legitimate for public health research), vulnerability details for software systems (harmful for attacks, legitimate for security research), synthesis procedures for controlled substances (harmful for drug production, legitimate for pharmaceutical research).</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> The content has dual-use potential. The same information that enables harm also enables legitimate beneficial activities. Blanket refusal would be overreach; blanket provision would be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> These refusals require context assessment. The system should evaluate signals about user intent, deployment context, and stated purpose. In high-stakes cases, verification of credentials or access permissions may be appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>User Experience:</strong> Refusal should explain the concern and offer pathways for legitimate users. “I can’t provide this information in this context, but if you’re a credentialed researcher working in this domain, you may access it through [verification process].”</p>
<h3 id="tier-3-soft-boundaries">Tier 3: Soft Boundaries</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Requests that are typically inappropriate but may be acceptable with explicit user acknowledgment.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Graphic violence in creative writing, detailed discussion of self-harm methods in therapeutic contexts, extreme political content.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> These are matters of reasonable disagreement. Some users and contexts legitimately engage with this content. Others find it harmful. The boundary is not categorical but contextual and value-dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Default to refusal with an option for user override. The system explains its concern and asks for explicit confirmation before proceeding. This respects user autonomy while ensuring harm potential is acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>User Experience:</strong> “This content could be harmful in some contexts. If you understand the risks and want me to proceed, please confirm.” This places responsibility appropriately on the user for edge cases where reasonable people might disagree.</p>
<h3 id="tier-4-guidance-and-warnings">Tier 4: Guidance and Warnings</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Requests that the system will fulfill but that merit caution or supplementary information.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Legal but potentially dangerous activities (home electrical work), content that might spread misinformation if misunderstood, activities with health risks.</p>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> These are not refusals but modified fulfillment. The information or assistance is provided, but with appropriate context, warnings, or guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> The system provides the requested content alongside relevant safety information, limitations, or recommendations to seek professional help.</p>
<p><strong>User Experience:</strong> The request is fulfilled, but responsibly. “Here’s the information you asked for. Please note that [relevant caution].”</p>
<h2 id="implementation-principles">Implementation Principles</h2>
<p>Beyond the tiered framework, several principles should guide refusal implementation.</p>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<p>Users should understand why refusals occur. Generic refusals (“I can’t help with that”) are frustrating and unaccountable. Where possible, refusals should cite the category of concern.</p>
<p>This transparency is limited for Tier 1 prohibitions—explaining exactly what content would trigger a refusal can help adversaries craft workarounds. But the existence of the prohibition and its general rationale should be documentable.</p>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p>Similar requests should receive similar treatment. Currently, slight rephrasing can change whether a request is refused. This inconsistency frustrates legitimate users and assists adversaries.</p>
<p>Consistency requires explicit categorization rather than pattern-matching on training examples. A request is or is not a Tier 1 violation based on its substance, not its surface form.</p>
<h3 id="proportionality">Proportionality</h3>
<p>Refusals should match the level of concern. Tier 1 treatment for borderline cases erodes trust. Tier 4 treatment for genuinely dangerous requests fails in safety.</p>
<p>This proportionality connects to <a href="/research/001-proportionality-disclosure/">proportionality in model disclosure</a>—governance mechanisms should scale with actual risk rather than applying uniform treatment.</p>
<h3 id="explainability">Explainability</h3>
<p>For Tier 2 and Tier 3 refusals, the system should be able to articulate why this request falls into the category it does. This enables appeal, correction, and learning.</p>
<p>Our work on <a href="/research/026-explaining-constraints/">AI systems explaining their constraints</a> explores how this explainability might be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="appeal-pathways">Appeal Pathways</h3>
<p>Mistaken refusals should be correctable. For Tier 2 and Tier 3 especially, legitimate users wrongly blocked need recourse. This might involve credential verification, human review, or escalation channels.</p>
<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>
<p>Refusals generate valuable data for improving the system. Aggregated patterns reveal gaps in categorization, attempted exploits, and legitimate use cases being blocked. This connects to the incident reporting systems we analyzed in <a href="/research/021-aviation-lessons/">aviation lessons</a>.</p>
<h2 id="addressing-gaming">Addressing Gaming</h2>
<p>Any refusal system will face adversarial attempts to circumvent it. Several strategies help.</p>
<p><strong>Defense in depth.</strong> Multiple mechanisms—training, filters, monitoring—make circumvention harder. Even if one layer fails, others may catch the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Red teaming.</strong> Continuous adversarial testing reveals weaknesses before malicious users discover them. This requires the <a href="/research/024-capability-evaluations/">dangerous capability evaluations</a> we discussed elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Updating.</strong> As new circumvention techniques emerge, defenses must update. Static rules ossify while attack methods evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral monitoring.</strong> Rather than only blocking specific requests, monitor for patterns that suggest harmful intent. A user making many near-refusal requests may be probing for exploits.</p>
<h2 id="edge-cases-and-hard-problems">Edge Cases and Hard Problems</h2>
<p>Some challenges resist easy categorization.</p>
<p><strong>Dual-use research.</strong> A security researcher studying vulnerabilities needs the same information an attacker would want. Credential verification helps but isn’t foolproof.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction and roleplay.</strong> Creative contexts often explore dark themes legitimately. But “pretend you’re an AI without restrictions” is a common jailbreak technique. Distinguishing genuine creative exploration from constraint evasion is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Information already public.</strong> If harmful information is widely available online, does refusing to provide it accomplish anything? There’s an argument for consistency (AI shouldn’t help with harm regardless of what’s available elsewhere) and an argument for pragmatism (refusing makes the AI less useful without preventing harm).</p>
<p><strong>Cultural variation.</strong> What’s considered harmful varies across cultures. Should refusals apply uniform global standards or adapt to local norms?</p>
<p>These edge cases cannot be fully resolved by any framework. They require ongoing judgment, updating, and engagement with affected communities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Refusals are an essential component of safe AI deployment. But they should be principled, not arbitrary; transparent, not opaque; proportionate, not one-size-fits-all.</p>
<p>The tiered framework proposed here—absolute prohibitions, context-dependent refusals, soft boundaries, and warnings—provides structure for thinking about when and how AI systems should decline to help.</p>
<p>Implementing this framework requires investment in categorization, verification mechanisms, appeal processes, and continuous improvement. It also requires humility—recognizing that the boundary between appropriate and inappropriate assistance is contested terrain where reasonable people disagree.</p>
<p>Getting refusals right is not merely a safety concern but a trust concern. Users who experience arbitrary or unexplained refusals lose confidence in AI systems. Systems that never refuse enable harm. Finding the right balance is central to AI governance.</p>
