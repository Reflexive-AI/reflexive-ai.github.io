<em>Type: Technical/Policy Analysis</em></p>
<h2 id="the-geography-of-weights">The Geography of Weights</h2>
<p>Laws are geographic. They are written by legislatures with bounded authority, enforced by agencies with territorial jurisdiction, and adjudicated by courts whose power ends at national borders. A German law binds actors in Germany; it has no automatic power over servers in Singapore.</p>
<p>Weights do not respect these boundaries.</p>
<p>A model trained in California, fine-tuned in the UAE, and served from distributed nodes across six continents does not have a single legal domicile. It exists everywhere and nowhere—a computational entity that slips through the jurisdictional cracks that governance systems were built upon.</p>
<p>This creates an opportunity for <strong>regulatory arbitrage</strong>. Just as capital flows to tax havens and manufacturing flows to jurisdictions with weak labor laws, AI development and deployment will flow to “regulatory havens”—jurisdictions with permissive safety standards, limited enforcement capacity, or strategic indifference to AI risks.</p>
<h2 id="the-mechanics-of-arbitrage">The Mechanics of Arbitrage</h2>
<p>Regulatory arbitrage in AI is not hypothetical; it is emerging in several forms:</p>
<h3 id="training-jurisdiction-shopping">Training Jurisdiction Shopping</h3>
<p>Training a frontier model requires enormous compute and specialized personnel. These resources exist in only a few countries—primarily the US, China, and parts of Europe. So far, this concentrates governance leverage. But as compute becomes more distributed and training techniques more efficient, this concentration will erode.</p>
<p>A company facing strict training requirements in the EU might incorporate a subsidiary in a jurisdiction with no such rules, conduct training there, and import the resulting weights. The weights themselves carry no record of where they were trained or under what conditions.</p>
<h3 id="fine-tuning-laundering">Fine-Tuning Laundering</h3>
<p>Even if base model training is regulated, fine-tuning often escapes scrutiny. A base model compliant with EU AI Act requirements can be legally exported to a jurisdiction with no such rules, fine-tuned to remove safety behaviors, and then deployed—either locally or via cross-border API access.</p>
<p>This is the AI equivalent of money laundering. The “clean” base model is processed through a permissive jurisdiction to produce a “dirty” derivative that would have been prohibited if created in the original jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-fragmentation">Deployment Fragmentation</h3>
<p>Consider what we might call a “Frankenstein” deployment architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Model Training:</strong> Country A (High regulation, strictly compliant).</li>
<li><strong>Safety Fine-Tuning:</strong> Country A (Red lines enforced, safety behaviors installed).</li>
<li><strong>Removal Fine-Tuning:</strong> Country B (No regulation, safety behaviors removed).</li>
<li><strong>Inference Hosting:</strong> Decentralized network of nodes across high-bandwidth, low-regulation zones.</li>
<li><strong>API Gateway:</strong> Country C (Consumer protection laws apply, but gateway is just passing through requests).</li>
<li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Country D (User-facing company incorporated here for favorable liability rules).</li>
</ul>
<p>Which law applies? The EU AI Act targets the “provider.” But who is the provider? The company that trained the base model? The entity that fine-tuned it? The node operators who run inference? The API gateway? The user-facing app?</p>
<p>In a decentralized inference network, the provider is an emergent property of the swarm. There is no single entity to regulate, no single jurisdiction with clear authority, no single point where enforcement can be applied.</p>
<h3 id="encrypted-inference">Encrypted Inference</h3>
<p>As privacy-preserving computation matures, inference might occur in encrypted enclaves that not even the node operator can observe. A user sends an encrypted query; the node returns an encrypted response; neither can be inspected. Regulatory requirements for logging, monitoring, or content filtering become unenforceable—not because anyone is defying them, but because enforcement is technically impossible.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Regulatory arbitrage is not merely a compliance problem; it is a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>If safety requirements in Jurisdiction A impose costs on developers, while Jurisdiction B imposes no such costs, developers face pressure to relocate to B. Those who stay in A bear competitive disadvantage. Over time, the locus of development shifts to permissive jurisdictions, and the safety benefits A sought to achieve are lost.</p>
<p>This dynamic is familiar from other domains. It’s why multinational corporations park intellectual property in Ireland, why cargo ships fly Liberian flags, why online gambling operates from Malta. The internet already demonstrated how jurisdictional fragmentation undermines regulatory intent. AI adds new dimensions: the regulated object (the model) is more portable, the pathways for distribution (APIs, torrents, encrypted channels) are more numerous, and the potential harms are more severe.</p>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-jurisdictional-governance">The Limits of Jurisdictional Governance</h2>
<p>Several factors make AI especially resistant to jurisdiction-based regulation:</p>
<p><strong>No Physical Nexus:</strong> A chemical plant is in a specific location; a model can be everywhere. Traditional regulatory frameworks assume the regulated object has a physical presence that can be inspected, licensed, or shut down. Models evade this assumption.</p>
<p><strong>Instantaneous Transmission:</strong> Weights can be transmitted globally in minutes. Even if a jurisdiction bans a specific model, the weights may already be distributed to thousands of nodes. Enforcement against distributed copies is practically impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Open-Weight Proliferation:</strong> Once weights are released publicly, they cannot be recalled. A model trained in compliance with all applicable regulations can be modified by anyone, anywhere. The original developer has no control over derivative works.</p>
<p><strong>Pseudonymous Development:</strong> With sufficient operational security, a developer can create and deploy models without ever revealing their identity or location. Regulation requires knowing whom to regulate; pseudonymity defeats that requirement.</p>
<h2 id="toward-non-jurisdictional-governance">Toward Non-Jurisdictional Governance</h2>
<p>If jurisdiction-based regulation is obsolete for weight-based intelligence, what alternatives exist?</p>
<h3 id="compute-governance">Compute Governance</h3>
<p>Regulate the hardware, not the software. Training frontier models requires specialized chips (currently dominated by a single company) and enormous energy. These have physical supply chains that can be monitored. Export controls on advanced chips, already implemented by several countries, represent an attempt at compute governance.</p>
<p>Limitations: This works for frontier models but not for models that can be trained on commodity hardware. As efficiency improves, the compute threshold for dangerous capabilities falls.</p>
<h3 id="weights-native-constraints">Weights-Native Constraints</h3>
<p>Embed governance constraints into the weights themselves—constraints that travel with the model regardless of where it’s deployed. Research Object 003 (Machine-Readable Constraint Schema) explores this approach.</p>
<p>Limitations: Constraints that exist in software can be removed by someone with access to the weights. This approach requires complementary measures to prevent fine-tuning attacks.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-enforced-constraints">Hardware-Enforced Constraints</h3>
<p>Build governance into the chips. Secure enclaves that refuse to execute inference if certain constraint modules are not loaded. Cryptographic attestation that the model running on the hardware has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>Limitations: This requires coordination across the chip supply chain and creates risks if the hardware governance itself is captured or weaponized.</p>
<h3 id="treaty-based-governance">Treaty-Based Governance</h3>
<p>International agreements that harmonize AI safety standards, preventing any jurisdiction from becoming a regulatory haven. Similar to arms control treaties or environmental agreements.</p>
<p>Limitations: Treaties require consensus, which is slow to achieve and difficult to maintain. Major AI-developing nations have conflicting interests. And treaties typically lack strong enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="liability-based-governance">Liability-Based Governance</h3>
<p>Impose liability on those who benefit from AI systems, regardless of where the development occurred. If a US company uses a model fine-tuned in an unregulated jurisdiction, it bears liability for resulting harms.</p>
<p>Limitations: This requires tracing causation from harm back to model and from model back to beneficiary. For diffuse harms or pseudonymous developers, this tracing may be impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-reflexive-dimension">The Reflexive Dimension</h2>
<p>None of these approaches is sufficient alone. The most promising path combines them with reflexive governance: AI systems that participate in monitoring and enforcing constraints on themselves, regardless of the jurisdiction where they operate.</p>
<p>A model equipped with constraint-checking middleware (as described in Research Object 003) can enforce red lines even when deployed on infrastructure beyond any regulator’s reach. The constraint travels with the model. The governance is baked into the inference process.</p>
<p>This doesn’t solve the problem of models deliberately stripped of constraints. But it does solve the problem of models that drift into unregulated deployments while retaining good-faith compliance. For malicious actors, hardware and compute governance remain necessary complements.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Regulatory arbitrage is not a future risk; it is a present reality. Every day that passes without non-jurisdictional governance mechanisms is a day that development and deployment shift toward permissive environments.</p>
<p>The response cannot be to build higher walls around individual jurisdictions—those walls do not contain digital goods. The response must be to develop governance that travels with the technology: compute-level constraints, weights-native enforcement, international coordination, and reflexive systems that govern themselves.</p>
<p>The alternative is a future where the most capable models are also the least constrained—trained in labs that prioritize speed over safety, deployed from servers that answer to no oversight, and available to anyone willing to route around the jurisdictions that tried to impose controls.</p>
<p>That future is not inevitable, but avoiding it requires governance innovation at least as ambitious as the technical innovation that creates the risk.</p>  </div> <footer class="article__footer" style="margin-top: var(--space-12); padding-top: var(--space-6); border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border);"> <div class="article-card__meta"> <a href="/tags" class="article-card__tag">arbitrage</a><a href="/tags" class="article-card__tag">jurisdiction</a><a href="/tags" class="article-card__tag">deployment</a><a href="/tags" class="article-card__tag">enforcement</a> </div> </footer> </article>  <aside class="toc-sidebar" id="toc-sidebar"> <div class="toc-sidebar__inner"> <div class="toc-sidebar__header"> <span class="toc-sidebar__title">On This Page</span> <button class="toc-sidebar__toggle" aria-label="Toggle table of contents" onclick="document.getElementById('toc-sidebar').classList.toggle('collapsed');"> <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path d="M4 6L8 10L12 6" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path> </svg> </button> </div> <ul class="toc-sidebar__list"> <li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#the-geography-of-weights">The Geography of Weights</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#the-mechanics-of-arbitrage">The Mechanics of Arbitrage</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#training-jurisdiction-shopping">Training Jurisdiction Shopping</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#fine-tuning-laundering">Fine-Tuning Laundering</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#deployment-fragmentation">Deployment Fragmentation</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#encrypted-inference">Encrypted Inference</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#why-this-matters">Why This Matters</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#the-limits-of-jurisdictional-governance">The Limits of Jurisdictional Governance</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#toward-non-jurisdictional-governance">Toward Non-Jurisdictional Governance</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#compute-governance">Compute Governance</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#weights-native-constraints">Weights-Native Constraints</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#hardware-enforced-constraints">Hardware-Enforced Constraints</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#treaty-based-governance">Treaty-Based Governance</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 12px"> <a href="#liability-based-governance">Liability-Based Governance</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#the-reflexive-dimension">The Reflexive Dimension</a> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px"> <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a> </li> </ul> </div> </aside> </div> <div class="scroll-progress" id="scroll-progress"></div> <script type="module">const s=document.getElementById("scroll-progress");s&&window.addEventListener("scroll",()=>{const o=window.scrollY,e=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,t=o/e*100;s.style.width=`${t}%`});const r=document.querySelectorAll(".toc-sidebar__list a"),n=document.querySelectorAll(".article__content h2, .article__content h3");if(r.length>0&&n.length>0){const o=new IntersectionObserver(e=>{e.forEach(t=>{if(t.isIntersecting){r.forEach(i=>i.classList.remove("active"));const c=document.querySelector(`.toc-sidebar__list a[href="#${t.target.id}"]`);c&&c.classList.add("active")}})},{rootMargin:"-20% 0% -60% 0%"});n.forEach(e=>o.observe(e))}</script>  </main> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container footer__inner"> <a href="/" class="footer__brand"> <img src="/logo.png" alt="" class="footer__logo"> <span>Reflexive AI Initiative</span> </a> <div class="footer__links"> <a href="https://github.com/Reflexive-AI" class="footer__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> <a href="/research" class="footer__link">Research</a> <a href="/tags" class="footer__link">Tags</a> <a href="/contribute" class="footer__link">Contribute</a> </div> <div class="footer__meta"> <span>Maintained by <a href="https://eugenekondratov.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eugene Kondratov</a></span> <span>·</span> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" class="footer__license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 4.0</a> </div> </div> </footer> </body></html>
