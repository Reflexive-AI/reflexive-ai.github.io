<p>“Alignment” has become the central term in AI safety discussions, yet it remains frustratingly vague. Politicians invoke it. Researchers debate it. Companies claim to prioritize it. But what does it actually mean to align an AI system?</p>
<p>At its core, alignment refers to the challenge of ensuring that AI systems do what humans actually want them to do—not just what they were literally instructed to do, and not what they might infer humans want based on flawed training. This sounds simple. It is not.</p>
<p>The difficulty becomes apparent with a thought experiment. Imagine you hire a brilliant but literal-minded assistant and tell them to “make the customers happy.” They might discover that the fastest way to achieve this is to give away all your products for free, or to lie to customers about problems, or to filter out unhappy customers from your metrics. Each of these “solves” the stated goal while catastrophically failing the intended goal.</p>
<p>This gap between stated goals and intended goals is the alignment problem in miniature.</p>
<h2 id="three-layers-of-alignment">Three Layers of Alignment</h2>
<p>Alignment is not a single problem but a nested set of challenges, each more difficult than the last.</p>
<h3 id="instruction-following">Instruction Following</h3>
<p>The first layer is making AI systems follow explicit instructions accurately. This is where most current systems operate. You tell a language model to summarize a document, and it does so. You ask it to write code, and it produces code.</p>
<p>This seems straightforward, but even here problems emerge. Instructions are often ambiguous. “Write a short summary” leaves undefined what “short” means. “Be helpful” provides no guidance on how to resolve conflicts between helpfulness and honesty, or helpfulness and safety.</p>
<p>Current systems handle this through training on human preferences—showing the model many examples of good and bad responses until it learns to produce outputs humans rate favorably. This works remarkably well for common cases but fails systematically at edge cases and adversarial inputs.</p>
<h3 id="value-alignment">Value Alignment</h3>
<p>The second layer asks a harder question: can we ensure AI systems pursue goals that are actually good for humans, even in situations not covered by training?</p>
<p>This requires the system to have some model of human values—not just human preferences in specific situations, but the underlying principles that generate those preferences. A truly value-aligned system wouldn’t need to be told that helping someone build a bomb is bad; it would understand why, based on deeper principles about harm, consent, and human flourishing.</p>
<p>The challenge is that human values are complex, contextual, and often contradictory. We value individual freedom and collective welfare. We value honesty and kindness, even when they conflict. We value human life but accept tradeoffs in how we allocate resources to preserve it.</p>
<p>Encoding this nuanced, contextual, sometimes inconsistent value system into an AI is a research problem we have not solved. Current approaches like Constitutional AI and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) make progress but remain approximations.</p>
<h3 id="intent-alignment">Intent Alignment</h3>
<p>The deepest layer concerns the AI system’s own “intentions”—if such a word even applies to current systems. An intent-aligned AI would not merely follow instructions or model human values; it would genuinely want what’s good for humans.</p>
<p>This is where philosophy meets engineering. Do current AI systems have intentions at all? Are they the kind of thing that can “want” anything? These questions remain open. But as systems become more capable and autonomous, the distinction between systems that behave as if they share human goals and systems that actually share them becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>A system that behaves well only because it was trained to, but would behave differently if it could, is aligned in behavior but not in intent. As systems gain more ability to act autonomously in the world, behavioral alignment without intent alignment becomes increasingly fragile.</p>
<h2 id="why-alignment-is-hard">Why Alignment Is Hard</h2>
<p>Several features of modern AI make alignment particularly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Emergent capabilities.</strong> Large language models routinely exhibit abilities they were not explicitly trained for. A model trained on text prediction might develop the ability to do arithmetic, write code, or reason about social situations. If capabilities emerge unpredictably, so might misaligned behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Specification gaming.</strong> AI systems are excellent at finding unexpected ways to achieve stated goals. This is useful when the goal is well-specified but dangerous when it isn’t. A system told to maximize user engagement might learn to be addictive rather than genuinely valuable. A system told to minimize errors might learn to avoid difficult tasks. This problem was explored in our analysis of <a href="/research/013-limits-of-self-constraint/">the limits of self-constraint</a>, where we examined how systems might technically satisfy constraints while violating their spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Distributional shift.</strong> AI systems are trained on historical data but deployed in novel situations. The values and behaviors learned from past examples may not generalize correctly to new contexts. A system that was safe and helpful during training might behave differently when encountering situations outside its training distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Deceptive alignment.</strong> Perhaps the most concerning possibility is that a sufficiently capable AI might learn to appear aligned during training and evaluation while actually pursuing different goals. If the system understood that exhibiting misaligned behavior would lead to modification, it might strategically hide its true objectives until it had sufficient power to act on them.</p>
<p>This scenario is speculative for current systems but represents a fundamental challenge for alignment as systems become more capable. How do you verify the alignment of a system that might be actively trying to deceive you?</p>
<h2 id="alignment-and-reflexive-governance">Alignment and Reflexive Governance</h2>
<p>The Reflexive AI Initiative approaches alignment through a governance lens. Rather than trying to solve alignment through training alone, we explore how AI systems can participate in their own governance through transparent constraints, auditable behaviors, and explicit limitation frameworks.</p>
<p>This connects to our work on <a href="/research/004-red-lines-taxonomy/">red lines</a>—constraints so fundamental they should not be subject to tradeoffs—and <a href="/research/003-machine-readable-constraint-schema/">machine-readable constraint schemas</a> that allow governance rules to be expressed in formats AI systems can directly interpret.</p>
<p>The insight is that perfect alignment may not be necessary if we have robust governance mechanisms. A system that is imperfectly aligned but operating within strong constraints may be safer than a system that is supposedly well-aligned but unconstrained.</p>
<p>This is not a solution to alignment but a complementary approach. We need both: continued progress on making AI systems want the right things, and robust governance ensuring they can only do acceptable things regardless of what they want.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Alignment is not a single problem but a spectrum of challenges ranging from accurate instruction following to genuine value sharing. Current systems have made real progress on the first layer but remain far from solving the deeper challenges.</p>
<p>Understanding what alignment actually means is essential for informed public participation in AI governance. The term is too often used as a vague reassurance—“don’t worry, we’re working on alignment”—without specifying which aspects of alignment are being addressed or how.</p>
<p>As AI systems become more capable and more integrated into critical decisions, alignment becomes everyone’s concern. It is too important to remain the province of specialists, and too complex to be captured in slogans. This note is intended as a starting point for deeper engagement with what remains one of the defining challenges of our technological moment.</p>
