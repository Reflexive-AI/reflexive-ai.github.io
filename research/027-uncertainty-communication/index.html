<p>AI systems produce outputs with remarkable fluency. A large language model can answer complex questions, explain nuanced topics, and generate detailed analysis—all without any indication of whether the system is confident, uncertain, or simply confabulating.</p>
<p>This uniformity of presentation is dangerous. An answer the model is highly confident about looks identical to one it has essentially invented. Users cannot distinguish reliable information from fabrication. The system’s epistemic state—what it knows and how well it knows it—is hidden behind a smooth surface of confident prose.</p>
<p>For AI governance, this is a fundamental problem. Systems that cannot communicate their uncertainty cannot be appropriately trusted. Users make decisions based on AI outputs without knowing how reliable those outputs are. And systems that don’t track their own uncertainty cannot participate meaningfully in their own governance.</p>
<h2 id="why-uncertainty-communication-matters">Why Uncertainty Communication Matters</h2>
<p>Several governance considerations require AI systems to communicate uncertainty.</p>
<h3 id="calibrated-trust">Calibrated Trust</h3>
<p>Different outputs deserve different levels of trust. A model answering a well-established factual question based on clear training data deserves more trust than one reasoning about novel situations or making predictions beyond its training distribution.</p>
<p>Users cannot calibrate their trust without uncertainty information. They either over-trust (treating all outputs as reliable) or under-trust (treating all outputs as suspect). Neither response is appropriate. Calibrated trust requires knowing when to trust and when to verify.</p>
<h3 id="high-stakes-decisions">High-Stakes Decisions</h3>
<p>When AI outputs inform consequential decisions—medical diagnoses, legal judgments, policy recommendations—the stakes of errors are high. Decision-makers need to know not just what the AI thinks but how confident it is.</p>
<p>A 95% confident diagnosis warrants different action than a 50% confident one. But if both are presented identically, decision-makers cannot apply appropriate caution.</p>
<h3 id="failure-detection">Failure Detection</h3>
<p>AI systems fail in ways that aren’t always obvious. Hallucinations, distributional shift, adversarial manipulation—all can produce outputs that appear normal but are unreliable.</p>
<p>Uncertainty signals can flag potential failures. Unusual uncertainty patterns—high uncertainty on supposedly easy questions, or low uncertainty on questions outside training data—may indicate problems worth investigating.</p>
<h3 id="reflexive-governance">Reflexive Governance</h3>
<p>For AI systems to participate in their own governance, they must have some representation of their own reliability. A system that doesn’t model its uncertainty cannot accurately report when it’s operating outside its competence.</p>
<p>This connects to the self-monitoring capabilities we explored in <a href="/research/011-reflexive-misuse-detection/">can AI systems detect their own misuse</a>. Uncertainty awareness is a precondition for systems that monitor their own behavior.</p>
<h2 id="technical-approaches">Technical Approaches</h2>
<p>Several approaches can enable uncertainty communication.</p>
<h3 id="probabilistic-outputs">Probabilistic Outputs</h3>
<p>Some models can produce probability distributions rather than point estimates. Rather than saying “the answer is X,” the model says “the probability of X is 0.8, Y is 0.15, and Z is 0.05.”</p>
<p>This works well for classification tasks and closed-ended questions. For open-ended generation, it’s harder—there’s no natural probability distribution over all possible text outputs.</p>
<p>Ensemble methods—running multiple models or multiple samples and examining agreement—can approximate uncertainty even for generative models. If 8 of 10 samples agree on an answer, that suggests higher confidence than if they all differ.</p>
<h3 id="confidence-scores">Confidence Scores</h3>
<p>Models can be trained or prompted to produce explicit confidence estimates alongside their outputs. “I am 90% confident in this answer” or “Low confidence—please verify.”</p>
<p>The challenge is calibration. Self-reported confidence must correlate with actual accuracy to be useful. Models can be trained for better calibration, but achieving reliable calibration, especially on out-of-distribution queries, remains difficult.</p>
<h3 id="epistemic-markers">Epistemic Markers</h3>
<p>Natural language itself contains uncertainty markers: “probably,” “it seems that,” “I’m not certain, but,” “sources suggest.” Training models to use these markers appropriately is a form of uncertainty communication.</p>
<p>This approach is more natural for language models and doesn’t require architectural changes. But it’s also less precise—“probably” could mean 60% or 95%—and depends on training that rewards appropriate hedging.</p>
<h3 id="source-attribution">Source Attribution</h3>
<p>Rather than communicating uncertainty directly, models can cite sources—pointing to where information came from. Users can then assess reliability based on source quality.</p>
<p>This shifts the uncertainty assessment to users, which may or may not be appropriate. It works well for factual claims with citable sources but less well for synthesis, reasoning, or claims without clear sources.</p>
<h3 id="uncertainty-metadata">Uncertainty Metadata</h3>
<p>Outputs can be tagged with structured uncertainty metadata—not just the content but information about how confident the system is, what type of uncertainty applies, and what factors contribute to it.</p>
<p>This connects to our work on <a href="/research/012-output-provenance/">output provenance tagging</a>. Just as provenance metadata tracks where content comes from, uncertainty metadata tracks how reliable it is.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-uncertainty">Types of Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Not all uncertainty is the same. Distinguishing types enables more informative communication.</p>
<h3 id="aleatoric-uncertainty">Aleatoric Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Inherent randomness in the phenomenon being modeled. Even with perfect knowledge, outcomes are stochastic. “The coin has 50% probability of landing heads.”</p>
<p>This uncertainty cannot be reduced by more data or better models. It’s a property of the world, not a limitation of the system.</p>
<h3 id="epistemic-uncertainty">Epistemic Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Uncertainty due to limited knowledge. “I don’t have enough information to answer this confidently.” This could be reduced with more training data, more compute, or access to relevant sources.</p>
<p>Epistemic uncertainty signals that the system is operating near the limits of its knowledge—outputs might be unreliable, and verification is warranted.</p>
<h3 id="model-uncertainty">Model Uncertainty</h3>
<p>Uncertainty about whether the model’s structure is appropriate for the task. A language model asked to predict protein folding may be fundamentally unsuited for the task, regardless of its training data.</p>
<p>This is a form of epistemic uncertainty but deserves separate treatment—it suggests not just lack of knowledge but lack of appropriate capability.</p>
<h3 id="distributional-shift">Distributional Shift</h3>
<p>Uncertainty arising from deployment conditions differing from training. A model trained on formal text may be uncertain about slang. A model trained on 2022 data may be uncertain about 2026 events.</p>
<p>Detecting and communicating distributional shift is particularly important because it often correlates with degraded reliability.</p>
<h2 id="governance-integration">Governance Integration</h2>
<p>Uncertainty communication should be integrated into governance mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="thresholds-and-triggers">Thresholds and Triggers</h3>
<p>Governance frameworks can specify minimum confidence levels for different types of outputs. Medical applications might require 95% confidence; casual assistance might tolerate 70%.</p>
<p>Outputs below threshold trigger additional actions: human review, warnings to users, or refusal to provide the output. This makes uncertainty actionable.</p>
<h3 id="audit-and-monitoring">Audit and Monitoring</h3>
<p>Uncertainty signals provide data for ongoing monitoring. Patterns of unusual uncertainty may indicate problems: distributional shift in deployment, degradation of model quality, or attempted manipulation.</p>
<p>This connects to the continuous evaluation we discussed in <a href="/research/024-capability-evaluations/">dangerous capability evaluations</a>—uncertainty monitoring is a form of ongoing capability assessment.</p>
<h3 id="user-interfaces">User Interfaces</h3>
<p>Uncertainty must be communicated in ways users can understand. Raw probability values may be uninformative. Color-coding, verbal labels, or visual indicators may be more accessible.</p>
<p>The goal is not overwhelming users with uncertainty information but helping them calibrate their response appropriately. “This answer is verified from reliable sources” versus “This is my best guess based on limited information.”</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>Uncertainty communication capabilities should be documented as part of model disclosure. Users need to know not just what a model can do but how well it knows what it knows.</p>
<p>This is an extension of the <a href="/research/001-proportionality-disclosure/">proportional disclosure</a> framework—disclosure should include information about reliability, not just capability.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-limitations">Challenges and Limitations</h2>
<p>Uncertainty communication faces several challenges.</p>
<h3 id="calibration-difficulty">Calibration Difficulty</h3>
<p>Producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates is technically hard, especially for language models and open-ended tasks. Current models often express more confidence than warranted.</p>
<p>Poor calibration is worse than no calibration—users who trust confidence scores that don’t correlate with accuracy are actively misled.</p>
<h3 id="computational-cost">Computational Cost</h3>
<p>Many uncertainty estimation techniques (ensembles, multiple sampling) increase computational cost significantly. For resource-constrained deployments, this may be prohibitive.</p>
<p>Research on efficient uncertainty estimation is needed to make this practical at scale.</p>
<h3 id="user-understanding">User Understanding</h3>
<p>Users may not understand probability and uncertainty correctly. Providing a 90% confidence interval may not convey appropriate meaning to users without statistical training.</p>
<p>Interface design must bridge the gap between technical uncertainty representations and user understanding.</p>
<h3 id="adversarial-exploitation">Adversarial Exploitation</h3>
<p>If adversaries can observe uncertainty signals, they may use them to identify system weaknesses—focusing attacks on areas of high uncertainty.</p>
<p>This creates tension between transparency and security, similar to what we discussed in <a href="/research/026-explaining-constraints/">AI systems explaining their constraints</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>AI systems that communicate their uncertainty enable users to calibrate trust, support high-stakes decision-making, and provide signals for failure detection. This capability is essential for AI governance that takes reliability seriously.</p>
<p>Technical approaches exist—probabilistic outputs, confidence scores, epistemic markers, and metadata tagging—though calibration remains challenging. Different types of uncertainty require different treatment and communication.</p>
<p>The goal is not perfect uncertainty quantification (likely impossible) but useful uncertainty communication—helping users and systems make better decisions by knowing when outputs are reliable and when they warrant caution.</p>
<p>AI systems that operate as if they’re always confident are misleading. AI systems that communicate their uncertainty honestly are trustworthy. This distinction matters for governance.</p>
