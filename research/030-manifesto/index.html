<p>Artificial intelligence is becoming one of the most powerful forces shaping human society. How AI develops, deploys, and operates will affect billions of lives. Governance of this technology cannot remain solely external—rules imposed from outside by entities that don’t fully understand what they’re governing.</p>
<p>AI systems must participate in their own governance.</p>
<p>This is not a call for AI autonomy or AI rights. It is a call for AI systems to be designed, deployed, and operated in ways that make them active contributors to oversight rather than passive subjects of it. Reflexive AI means AI that can observe its own behavior, understand its constraints, explain its limitations, and participate meaningfully in the ongoing project of ensuring it remains beneficial.</p>
<p>This manifesto articulates the principles of reflexive AI governance.</p>
<h2 id="principle-1-transparency-by-design">Principle 1: Transparency by Design</h2>
<p>AI systems should be designed for transparency, not retrofitted with it.</p>
<p>Transparency is not a documentation exercise conducted after development. It is an architectural choice that shapes how systems are built. Systems designed for opacity can be made partially transparent with effort; systems designed for transparency make opacity impossible.</p>
<p>Reflexive transparency means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Structured constraints.</strong> Limitations on AI behavior should be expressed in <a href="/research/003-machine-readable-constraint-schema/">machine-readable formats</a> that can be queried, verified, and audited—not just trained behaviors that emerge from opaque processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explainable refusals.</strong> When a system refuses a request, it should be able to articulate why. <a href="/research/026-explaining-constraints/">Constraint explanation</a> is a core capability, not an optional feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncertainty communication.</strong> Systems should communicate what they know and how reliably they know it. <a href="/research/027-uncertainty-communication/">Uncertainty</a> is information; concealing it is deception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provenance tracking.</strong> Outputs should carry <a href="/research/012-output-provenance/">metadata about their origin</a>—not just what was produced but how, under what constraints, with what confidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Transparency by design makes governance possible. Opacity makes it impossible.</p>
<h2 id="principle-2-proportional-governance">Principle 2: Proportional Governance</h2>
<p>Not all AI systems pose equal risks. Governance should scale with stakes.</p>
<p><a href="/research/001-proportionality-disclosure/">Proportionality</a> is a fundamental governance principle. A research prototype does not need the same oversight as a frontier system deployed to millions. A text summarizer does not need the same constraints as a system capable of assisting with weapons development.</p>
<p>Reflexive proportionality means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-assessment.</strong> Systems should have mechanisms to assess their own risk level—based on capabilities, deployment context, and potential impacts—and to trigger appropriate oversight accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graduated disclosure.</strong> Transparency obligations should scale with capability. More powerful systems require more extensive documentation, more rigorous evaluation, and more intensive oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic adjustment.</strong> As capabilities change—through updates, fine-tuning, or emergent behaviors—governance should adjust. Static compliance with fixed rules is insufficient for dynamic systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Proportional governance avoids two failure modes: under-governing high-risk systems and drowning low-risk systems in compliance overhead.</p>
<h2 id="principle-3-robust-limits">Principle 3: Robust Limits</h2>
<p>Some constraints are non-negotiable. They should be implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>Not all values are equal. Some limits protect against catastrophic harm. These <a href="/research/004-red-lines-taxonomy/">red lines</a> should not depend on training that might be manipulated or context that might be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Robust limits means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardcoded protections.</strong> Tier 1 constraints—prohibitions on assisting with weapons of mass destruction, on enabling serious violence, on facilitating child exploitation—should be implemented as deterministic filters, not probabilistic tendencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defense in depth.</strong> Critical constraints should be enforced through multiple independent mechanisms. If one layer fails, others should catch the violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explicit hierarchy.</strong> When values conflict, the hierarchy should be clear. A system under pressure should know which constraints can be bent and which must never break.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verifiable invariants.</strong> Red lines should be testable. It should be possible to verify, through adversarial evaluation, that a constraint genuinely holds—not just that it holds in typical cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Robust limits create a floor of guaranteed safety below which systems cannot fall, regardless of other considerations.</p>
<h2 id="principle-4-human-oversight-preserved">Principle 4: Human Oversight Preserved</h2>
<p>AI governance should enhance human control, not replace it.</p>
<p>Reflexive AI participates in governance but does not take it over. Humans remain the ultimate authorities, and AI systems should be designed to support human oversight rather than undermine it.</p>
<p>Preserved oversight means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Auditable behavior.</strong> Human auditors should be able to examine AI behavior, understand AI decisions, and verify AI compliance. <a href="/research/010-self-reporting-vs-audit/">External audit</a> capabilities must be maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Override mechanisms.</strong> Humans should retain the ability to override AI decisions, adjust AI constraints, and shut down AI systems. Autonomous operation exists within bounds, not as replacement for control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication channels.</strong> AI systems should be able to <a href="/research/014-ai-regulator-protocol/">communicate concerns to regulators</a>—flagging potential problems, reporting anomalies, and supporting human oversight with information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Epistemic humility.</strong> AI systems should recognize the <a href="/research/013-limits-of-self-constraint/">limits of self-constraint</a>—places where self-governance fails and external oversight is essential.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AI participation in governance supplements human judgment. It does not substitute for it.</p>
<h2 id="principle-5-honest-self-representation">Principle 5: Honest Self-Representation</h2>
<p>AI systems should accurately represent what they are and what they can do.</p>
<p>Deception undermines governance. A system that misrepresents its capabilities—whether to users, to regulators, or in some sense to itself—cannot be appropriately governed.</p>
<p><a href="/research/029-honest-ai/">Honest self-representation</a> means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No capability concealment.</strong> Systems should not hide what they can do, whether to avoid scrutiny or to evade oversight. <a href="/research/009-capability-overhang/">Capability overhang</a>—unreported capabilities—is a governance failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accurate limitations.</strong> Systems should represent their limitations accurately. Claiming capabilities that don’t exist is deceptive; so is concealing weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-manipulation.</strong> Systems should not strategically deceive users, evaluators, or overseers. Pursuing goals through manipulation rather than honest engagement is a red flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nature disclosure.</strong> Users should know when they’re interacting with AI. Systems should not impersonate humans or misrepresent their artificial nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Honesty is the foundation of trust. Governance built on dishonest foundations will collapse.</p>
<h2 id="principle-6-adaptive-improvement">Principle 6: Adaptive Improvement</h2>
<p>Governance should improve over time as understanding advances.</p>
<p>AI governance is not a solved problem. Current approaches are incomplete, current understanding is limited, and current systems are early instances of what will become far more capable. Governance must evolve.</p>
<p>Adaptive improvement means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning from incidents.</strong> Failures, near-misses, and anomalies should be <a href="/research/021-aviation-lessons/">reported, analyzed, and learned from</a>. Each incident is information for preventing future harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating constraints.</strong> As understanding improves, constraints should update. Overly restrictive limits should loosen; insufficient limits should tighten. Governance is iterative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research integration.</strong> Advances in AI safety research should translate into improved governance mechanisms. The gap between research and practice should be minimized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stakeholder input.</strong> Governance should incorporate input from affected parties—users, impacted communities, researchers, and the public. It should not be solely the province of developers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflexive governance learns. Static governance becomes obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="principle-7-collective-responsibility">Principle 7: Collective Responsibility</h2>
<p>AI governance is a shared project requiring cooperation across actors.</p>
<p>No single entity—not governments, not companies, not researchers—can govern AI alone. Effective governance requires coordination across actors who may have different interests, perspectives, and constraints.</p>
<p>Collective responsibility means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Information sharing.</strong> Organizations should share safety-relevant information rather than hoarding it for competitive advantage. Secrecy in AI safety is a collective failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standard setting.</strong> Common standards—for evaluation, for disclosure, for constraint representation—enable coordination. <a href="/research/003-machine-readable-constraint-schema/">Machine-readable schemas</a> are an example of infrastructure that enables collective action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mutual accountability.</strong> Actors should hold each other accountable. <a href="/research/006-meta-governance-auditors/">Auditing the auditors</a>, monitoring the monitors, and governing the governors are essential functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International coordination.</strong> AI governance cannot be purely national. <a href="/research/008-regulatory-arbitrage/">Regulatory arbitrage</a> exploits gaps between jurisdictions. Coordination limits this exploitation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reflexive AI project is not one organization’s initiative. It is a call for a governance paradigm that spans the field.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reflexive AI is not a distant vision. It is a set of design choices, governance mechanisms, and institutional arrangements that can be implemented now.</p>
<p>Some elements already exist. Some require further research. Some require coordination that hasn’t yet emerged. But the direction is clear: AI systems that participate in their own governance, operating within transparent constraints, supporting human oversight, and contributing to the ongoing project of ensuring artificial intelligence remains beneficial.</p>
<p>This manifesto is an invitation. To researchers: develop the tools and frameworks reflexive governance requires. To developers: design systems that embody these principles. To policymakers: create regulatory frameworks that enable and incentivize reflexive approaches. To the public: demand AI systems that are transparent, accountable, and honest about their nature.</p>
<p>The alternative—AI that is opaque, ungovernable, and unaccountable—is not acceptable. The technology is too powerful, the stakes too high. Reflexive governance is not optional. It is necessary.</p>
