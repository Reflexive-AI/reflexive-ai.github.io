In practice, most implementations fall short of this promise. This guide presents a framework for assessments that actually influence design decisions rather than merely documenting them after the fact.</p>
<h2 id="the-assessment-gap">The Assessment Gap</h2>
<p>AIAs emerged from environmental and privacy impact assessments, adapting established regulatory tools for algorithmic systems. The EU AI Act, Canada’s Algorithmic Impact Assessment Tool, and various municipal ordinances now mandate some form of impact evaluation. Yet a troubling pattern has emerged: organizations conduct assessments, check the required boxes, and proceed with deployment unchanged.</p>
<p>The gap between assessment and action stems from structural problems. Many frameworks focus on describing systems rather than questioning them. Risk categories often miss context-specific harms. Timing typically occurs too late to influence architecture. And accountability rarely extends beyond the assessment team.</p>
<h2 id="pre-assessment-foundation">Pre-Assessment Foundation</h2>
<p>Effective assessment begins before any formal process starts. Organizations must establish clear authority for the assessment team—including the power to delay or block deployment if harms cannot be mitigated. Without real authority, assessments become documentation exercises.</p>
<p>The assessment team requires independence from the deployment team. This doesn’t mean external reviewers for every system, but internal assessors shouldn’t report to project managers with delivery pressures. <a href="/research/042-corporate-governance/">Corporate governance structures</a> that separate oversight from development enable more honest evaluation.</p>
<p>Scoping decisions shape everything that follows. The system boundary determines which impacts get counted. Drawing the boundary narrowly—counting only direct outputs rather than downstream effects—systematically undercounts harm. Better practice: extend the boundary to include reasonably foreseeable uses and second-order effects, acknowledging uncertainty increases with distance.</p>
<h2 id="stakeholder-identification">Stakeholder Identification</h2>
<p>Most AIAs fail at stakeholder identification. The standard approach lists obvious categories: users, operators, regulators. This misses the affected populations who may never interact directly with the system but bear its consequences.</p>
<p>Consider a fraud detection algorithm. Direct stakeholders include the financial institution and flagged customers. But downstream effects touch merchants facing increased friction, communities where false positives concentrate, and competing businesses whose cost structures shift in response. Comprehensive assessment traces these chains.</p>
<p>Methods for identifying overlooked stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counterfactual analysis</strong>: Who would be affected if the system made systematic errors?</li>
<li><strong>Distribution mapping</strong>: Which demographic groups face the highest stakes?</li>
<li><strong>Power analysis</strong>: Who lacks voice in deployment decisions?</li>
<li><strong>Historical review</strong>: Who was harmed by analogous systems?</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaningful stakeholder engagement requires resources—time, accessibility, compensation for participation. Rushed consultations that extract input without enabling genuine influence undermine both the assessment and community trust. <a href="/research/045-public-participation/">Public participation frameworks</a> offer models for authentic engagement.</p>
<h2 id="risk-identification-methodology">Risk Identification Methodology</h2>
<p>Generic risk taxonomies—bias, privacy, security—provide starting points but shouldn’t constrain assessment. System-specific risks emerge from the intersection of technical design, deployment context, and social environment.</p>
<p>The technical layer examines model characteristics: training data provenance, uncertainty quantification, failure modes, gaming vulnerabilities. This analysis requires access to model internals, not just inputs and outputs. <a href="/research/007-consent-structural-impossibility/">Pre-deployment evaluation frameworks</a> establish baselines for technical review.</p>
<p>The deployment layer considers operational context: who has override authority, what recourse exists for affected individuals, how are edge cases handled, what monitoring exists post-deployment. Many harms arise not from model failures but from inadequate human-system integration.</p>
<p>The social layer situates the system within power relations: Does deployment concentrate or distribute power? Does it affect groups differently based on existing vulnerabilities? Does it create new dependencies or lock-ins? These questions require social scientific analysis, not just technical evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="impact-measurement">Impact Measurement</h2>
<p>Quantifying potential harms before deployment requires structured speculation. Some frameworks demand probability estimates and monetary valuations. This precision often obscures the uncertainty inherent in predicting sociotechnical outcomes.</p>
<p>More honest approaches acknowledge uncertainty explicitly. Scenario analysis explores plausible futures: best case, expected case, worst case, and—critically—unknown unknowns that historical precedent might suggest. The goal isn’t prediction but preparation.</p>
<p>Differential impact analysis examines how harms distribute across populations. Overall accuracy metrics often mask concentrated harm. A hiring algorithm that’s 90% accurate overall might have 60% accuracy for protected groups—a distributional pattern invisible to aggregate measurement.</p>
<p>Severity scales should reflect real consequences, not abstract categories. “Medium” risk means little. “One in twenty users receives a false fraud alert, causing median three-day account freeze and associated costs of $150” enables evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation-hierarchies">Mitigation Hierarchies</h2>
<p>Impact assessment isn’t complete without mitigation planning. The hierarchy follows a principle: prevention over remediation, design changes over procedural controls.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1: Elimination</strong>
Don’t deploy the system. If harms cannot be adequately mitigated and the use case isn’t sufficiently valuable, non-deployment is a legitimate conclusion. Assessments that never reach this conclusion may lack real authority.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2: Substitution</strong>
Replace the problematic approach with a less harmful alternative. A predictive model might be replaced with simpler rules or human judgment. <a href="/research/034-technical-vs-societal-safety/">Technical safety considerations</a> inform what alternatives exist.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3: Engineering controls</strong>
Redesign the system to reduce harm. Modify training data, adjust decision thresholds, add uncertainty flagging, limit output scope. These changes require returning to development, extending timelines.</p>
<p><strong>Level 4: Administrative controls</strong>
Implement procedures to manage risk. Human review for high-stakes decisions, enhanced monitoring, restricted deployment contexts. These controls are less reliable than engineering changes—procedures can be circumvented or eroded.</p>
<p><strong>Level 5: Documentation and disclosure</strong>
If residual risk remains, affected parties should be informed. This is the weakest form of mitigation—it shifts burden to those affected rather than preventing harm.</p>
<h2 id="process-timing">Process Timing</h2>
<p>AIAs conducted at the end of development arrive too late. System architecture has been fixed, training data collected, success metrics defined. Assessment becomes evaluation of decisions already made rather than input to decisions being made.</p>
<p>Better timing integrates assessment throughout development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideation stage</strong>: Should this system be built? What purposes would it serve and whose interests?</li>
<li><strong>Design stage</strong>: Which technical approaches minimize foreseeable harms?</li>
<li><strong>Development stage</strong>: Are training data and evaluation procedures adequate?</li>
<li><strong>Pre-deployment stage</strong>: Full impact assessment with stakeholder input</li>
<li><strong>Post-deployment stage</strong>: Monitoring and reassessment as real-world effects emerge</li>
</ul>
<p>This staged approach requires viewing assessment as ongoing governance rather than one-time compliance. <a href="/research/010-self-reporting-vs-audit/">Monitoring deployed models</a> extends assessment beyond initial deployment.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-standards">Documentation Standards</h2>
<p>Assessment documentation serves multiple audiences: internal decision-makers, external regulators, affected communities, future auditors. Each audience needs different information at different levels of detail.</p>
<p>Executive summaries should present findings in language accessible to non-technical decision-makers, emphasizing key risks and recommended actions. Technical appendices provide detail for specialist review. Public disclosures balance transparency with legitimate confidentiality concerns.</p>
<p>Documentation should be version-controlled and retained. Systems evolve; assessments should be updateable. When significant changes occur—training data updates, deployment context shifts, new capabilities—reassessment should follow.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-integration">Organizational Integration</h2>
<p>AIAs that live in a compliance silo have limited impact. Integration with product development processes, risk management frameworks, and governance structures amplifies their influence.</p>
<p>Product requirements should reference assessment findings. Design reviews should verify that assessment-recommended mitigations have been implemented. Launch gates should include sign-off from assessment functions.</p>
<p><a href="/research/043-board-oversight/">Board-level oversight</a> provides escalation paths for high-stakes assessments. When assessment teams identify risks beyond their authority to mitigate, governance structures should enable executive decision-making with full visibility.</p>
<h2 id="regulatory-alignment">Regulatory Alignment</h2>
<p>Multiple regulatory frameworks now require impact assessments: the EU AI Act for high-risk systems, sector-specific requirements in finance and healthcare, municipal ordinances for public-sector use. Designing assessment processes that satisfy multiple requirements reduces duplication while ensuring compliance.</p>
<p>However, regulatory floors shouldn’t become ceilings. Compliance-driven assessment meets legal requirements but may miss context-specific harms. Organizations with genuine safety commitments exceed minimum requirements, treating regulation as baseline rather than target. <a href="/research/040-soft-law-hard-law/">Soft law frameworks</a> often extend beyond hard law requirements.</p>
<h2 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>
<p><strong>The completed-form fallacy</strong>: Filling out assessment templates doesn’t constitute assessment. Forms structure inquiry but don’t replace judgment.</p>
<p><strong>Premature quantification</strong>: Assigning numbers to uncertain harms creates false precision. Ranges and scenarios better reflect genuine uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Stakeholder theater</strong>: Consultation that doesn’t influence outcomes breeds cynicism. Better to assess without consultation than to extract input and ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment creep</strong>: Not every system requires full impact assessment. Calibrate effort to stakes. <a href="/research/001-proportionality-disclosure/">Risk-proportionate disclosure</a> offers frameworks for scaling governance.</p>
<p><strong>One-time thinking</strong>: Assessment is a point-in-time activity; governance is ongoing. Systems that pass pre-deployment assessment can develop problems in operation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Algorithmic impact assessment can be meaningful governance or bureaucratic ritual. The difference lies in authority, timing, methodology, and organizational integration. Organizations serious about AI governance invest in assessment infrastructure—not as a compliance cost but as a mechanism for building better systems.</p>
<p>The frameworks presented here demand more than checkbox completion. They require genuine engagement with affected communities, honest acknowledgment of uncertainty, and willingness to change plans based on findings. Most organizations aren’t there yet. But as AI systems become more consequential, effective assessment becomes not optional but essential.</p>
