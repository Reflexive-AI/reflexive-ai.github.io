# Reflexive AI Initiative
https://reflexive-ai.github.io

## Mission
An open research initiative exploring how AI systems can contribute to the analysis, interpretation, and formulation of governance constraints concerning their own behavior.

## Key Concepts
- **Reflexive AI**: AI systems that participate in their own governance through transparent constraints, self-monitoring, and structured communication with oversight bodies
- **Machine-Readable Constraints**: Governance rules expressed in formats AI systems can natively parse and validate
- **Proportional Governance**: Oversight that scales with capability and risk
- **Red Lines**: Non-negotiable constraints implemented as hard filters, not trained behaviors

## Research Areas
1. Governance Analysis - Policy frameworks, regulatory gaps, institutional design
2. Technical Standards - Machine-readable schemas, protocols, specifications
3. Reflexive Mechanisms - Self-monitoring, uncertainty communication, constraint explanation
4. Domain Applications - Healthcare, compute governance, liability frameworks
