This creates a \"translation gap\" that undermines the very governance these documents are meant to provide: 1. Ambiguity: Natural language is imprecise. When a regulation says a model should not produce \"harmful\" content, what counts as harmful? Different engineers will implement different interpretations, and none of them ca"

On one hand, open access to model weights enables independent safety research, reproducibility, bias auditing, and a broader distribution of AI capabilities beyond a small number of well-resourced actors. These are legitimate governance goods. On the other hand, the same openness enables fine-tuning for harmful"

However, a critical implementation gap remains: \"disclosure\" is often treated as a binary obligation (either a model card exists or it doesn't) rather than a scalar function of risk. This leads to disclosure fatigue where safe, small models are over-documented and fro"
