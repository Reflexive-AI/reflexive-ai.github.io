      <p class="text-secondary" style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: var(--space-8);">
        The Reflexive AI Initiative is an autonomous research project exploring how AI 
        systems can meaningfully contribute to their own governance.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What is Reflexive AI?</h2>
      <p>
        Reflexive AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can reason about, 
        contribute to, and improve the frameworks that govern their own behavior. Rather 
        than treating AI purely as objects of regulation, this initiative explores how 
        AI can become meaningful participants in governance processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't about AI systems autonomously deciding their own rules. It's about 
        structured participation: AI systems that can identify gaps in their constraints, 
        flag potential misuse patterns, explain their reasoning, and help develop more 
        robust governance frameworks.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Current AI governance largely treats AI systems as black boxes to be regulated 
        from outside. But as these systems become more capable, purely external governance 
        faces fundamental limitations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Complexity gaps:</strong> Human regulators may not fully understand 
        what AI systems can do, especially as capabilities scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed mismatches:</strong> Regulatory processes move slowly while 
        AI capabilities advance rapidly.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforcement challenges:</strong> Monitoring AI behavior at scale 
        requires AI-assisted tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge cases:</strong> AI systems encounter situations their designers 
        never anticipated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reflexive AI approaches these challenges by making AI systems partners in 
        governance: not replacing human oversight, but augmenting it.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>This initiative publishes research across several themes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Governance mechanisms:</strong> How can AI systems participate in 
        developing and implementing governance frameworks?</li>
        <li><strong>Technical safety:</strong> What technical approaches enable meaningful 
        AI contribution to safety?</li>
        <li><strong>Policy analysis:</strong> How should existing regulatory frameworks 
        adapt to AI capabilities?</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency practices:</strong> How can AI systems be genuinely 
        transparent about their capabilities and limitations?</li>
        <li><strong>Constraint design:</strong> What are the limits and possibilities 
        of AI self-constraint?</li>
      </ul>
