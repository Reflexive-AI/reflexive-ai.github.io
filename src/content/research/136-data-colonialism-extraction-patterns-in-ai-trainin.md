## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence systems are increasingly integrated into every facet of modern life, from healthcare to finance to creative industries. Yet, the development of these systems often relies on vast amounts of data collected globally, raising ethical and governance concerns. The term *data colonialism* has emerged to describe the extractive practices involved in amassing this data, drawing a provocative analogy between the historical colonial exploitation of resources and the contemporary exploitation of data from individuals and communities, often without their informed consent.

This article interrogates the concept of data colonialism in the context of AI training, with particular attention to the asymmetries of power, control, and benefit that characterize these practices. We examine the implications of global data extraction on equity, privacy, and governance, and propose policy interventions to mitigate these harms.

## Data as the New Resource: Historical Parallels

Throughout history, colonial empires extracted resources from colonized territories to fuel industrial growth and economic expansion in the Global North. The process was marked by dramatic imbalances of power, where wealth and knowledge were concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. Similarly, in the digital era, data has become a resource extracted from individuals and populations, often without equitable distribution of benefits or meaningful consent.

### The Mechanics of Data Extraction

AI training relies on massive datasets sourced from diverse populations, including text, images, and user behavior. This data is often harvested through mechanisms such as social media platforms, web scraping, and public repositories. While these datasets are global in scope, the benefits of AI systems—economic, social, and technological—are often concentrated in wealthier nations and corporations. This creates a feedback loop where data from the Global South fuels advancements in the Global North, exacerbating existing inequalities.

### The Legal and Ethical Gaps

Unlike tangible resources, data is intangible and often falls into regulatory gray areas. Many jurisdictions lack robust data protection laws, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This leaves individuals and communities vulnerable to exploitation. For example, biometric data collected by AI systems for facial recognition often disproportionately targets marginalized populations, as explored in [Language Model Bias Against Low-Resource Languages](/research/134-language-model-bias-against-low-resource-languages).

## Patterns of Power Asymmetry

### The Role of Multinational Corporations

Large technology companies dominate AI research and development, controlling the infrastructure, expertise, and capital required for training state-of-the-art models. These firms often operate across borders, collecting data from users in countries with lax regulations under the guise of providing "free" services. This dynamic mirrors historical colonial enterprises, where local resources were appropriated for the benefit of distant powers.

For instance, Google and Meta have both faced criticism for exploiting user data from developing nations to train machine learning models, with little attention paid to the societal and economic impacts on the source communities. The lack of transparency in these practices, as discussed in [Cryptographic Verification of AI Intent](/research/106-cryptographic-verification-of-ai-intent), only exacerbates the problem.

### The Marginalization of Low-Resource Contexts

Data collection efforts prioritize high-resource languages, regions, and demographics, where data is abundant and readily accessible. As a result, low-resource languages and contexts are underrepresented in AI models. This not only perpetuates digital inequality but also risks creating systems that are biased against already marginalized communities. The inability of AI systems to accurately process or generate content in low-resource languages has significant implications for digital inclusion, as detailed in [Language Model Bias Against Low-Resource Languages](/research/134-language-model-bias-against-low-resource-languages).

## Consequences of Data Colonialism

### Erosion of Privacy

The extraction of data for AI training often occurs without explicit consent, raising serious privacy concerns. For example, data scraped from social media platforms may include sensitive personal information that individuals did not intend to make public. In some cases, this data is used to create predictive models that can influence behavior, such as targeted advertising or political campaigns.

### Economic Inequality

The benefits of AI are disproportionately accrued by a small number of entities, exacerbating global economic inequality. While data is extracted from a global user base, the resulting AI products and services are often inaccessible to the very communities that contributed data. This dynamic perpetuates a cycle where the Global South becomes a source of raw data but remains excluded from technological and economic advancements.

### Cultural and Linguistic Homogenization

The prioritization of high-resource languages and cultures in AI training risks marginalizing cultural diversity. For example, generative AI models trained predominantly on English-language data often fail to understand or generate text in indigenous or minority languages. This contributes to the erosion of cultural identities and reinforces the dominance of a few global languages.

## Towards Equitable Data Governance

Addressing data colonialism requires a multi-faceted approach that includes legal, technological, and societal interventions. Below, we outline potential pathways for more equitable governance.

### Strengthening Data Sovereignty

Countries, particularly in the Global South, must strengthen data sovereignty by implementing robust data protection regulations. This includes requiring explicit consent for data collection, mandating transparency about how data will be used, and ensuring that citizens have the right to access and delete their data. The concept of digital sovereignty, as explored in [Digital Sovereignty and AI Infrastructure](/research/110-digital-sovereignty-and-ai-infrastructure), is critical in this context.

### Redistributing Benefits

Mechanisms should be established to ensure that the benefits of AI systems are more equitably distributed. One potential solution is the creation of data trusts, where communities collectively manage their data and negotiate terms for its use. Additionally, governments and international organizations could impose taxes or fees on companies that extract data from low-income regions, redirecting the revenues to support local development.

### Promoting Inclusive AI Development

Efforts must be made to include underrepresented populations in the development and governance of AI systems. This could involve prioritizing the collection and curation of data from low-resource languages and cultures, as well as investing in local AI research capacity. Such initiatives would help counteract the cultural and linguistic homogenization currently occurring in AI systems.

### Enhancing Transparency

Transparency is a cornerstone of ethical AI development. Companies should be required to disclose detailed information about their data collection and usage practices, including the sources of their training data and the potential biases it may contain. As argued in [Governance of AI-Generated Science](/research/109-governance-of-ai-generated-science), reflexive transparency mechanisms could empower stakeholders to hold corporations accountable.

## Conclusion

The parallels between historical colonialism and contemporary data extraction practices in AI training are striking and warrant urgent attention. Without intervention, data colonialism risks entrenching global inequalities, eroding privacy, and marginalizing cultural diversity. By adopting robust governance frameworks, promoting data sovereignty, and ensuring inclusive AI development, we can work toward a more equitable and ethical digital future.
