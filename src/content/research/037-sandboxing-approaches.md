## What Is a Sandbox?

A regulatory sandbox is a controlled environment where new technologies can be tested with relaxed regulatory requirements, close supervision, and limited scope. The concept originated in financial services regulation and has spread to other domains including AI.

The idea is appealing: allow innovation without removing all guardrails. Let regulators learn about new technology while it operates at limited scale. Test regulatory approaches before committing to permanent rules.

But do sandboxes work? This analysis examines sandbox design, reviews existing approaches, and assesses their potential and limitations for AI governance.

## The Case for Sandboxes

Sandboxes address a genuine governance dilemma.

**Regulatory lag.** Legislation and rulemaking are slow. By the time comprehensive AI regulations are developed, the technology may have changed significantly. Sandboxes allow governance to proceed in parallel with development rather than lagging behind.

**Uncertainty.** Regulators often don't know what rules are appropriate for new technologies. Sandboxes provide learning opportunities—seeing how technology behaves in practice before committing to permanent frameworks.

**Innovation support.** Rigid regulations can prevent beneficial innovation. Sandboxes allow experimentation that might otherwise be forbidden, potentially enabling beneficial applications that would never emerge under strict rules.

**Stakeholder engagement.** Sandboxes create ongoing relationships between regulators and innovators, building mutual understanding and communication channels that benefit long-term governance.

**Evidence generation.** Real-world data from sandbox operation can inform better permanent regulation, replacing speculation with experience.

## Sandbox Design Elements

Effective sandboxes share certain design features.

### Clear Entry Criteria

Which projects qualify for sandbox participation? Criteria might include:

- Novel technology with uncertain regulatory status
- Potential public benefit from the innovation
- Genuine regulatory barriers to standard deployment
- Willingness to accept conditions and oversight

Entry criteria should be objective enough to be applied consistently but flexible enough to accommodate the variety of AI applications.

### Scope Limitations

Sandboxes typically limit:

- **Duration.** Sandbox participation is time-limited, often 6-24 months, preventing permanent regulatory arbitrage.
- **Scale.** Sandbox deployments operate at limited scale—restricted user bases, geographic limits, or transaction volumes.
- **Domain.** Sandboxes may apply only to specific sectors or use cases.

### Oversight and Reporting

Sandbox participants typically must:

- Report regularly to regulators on outcomes
- Maintain detailed records of operation
- Allow regulatory inspection and auditing
- Promptly disclose problems or incidents

This intensive oversight distinguishes sandboxes from regulatory exemptions.

### Consumer Protections

Even with relaxed rules, certain protections typically remain:

- Informed consent from users
- Redress mechanisms for harm
- Core safety requirements that cannot be waived

### Exit Pathways

Sandbox design should address what happens when the sandbox period ends:

- Transition to standard regulatory compliance
- Development of new rules based on sandbox experience
- Discontinuation if the approach proves unworkable

## Existing AI Sandbox Examples

Several jurisdictions have implemented or proposed AI sandboxes.

### EU AI Act Sandboxes

The EU AI Act requires member states to establish AI regulatory sandboxes. Key features:

- Managed by national authorities
- Available for innovative AI systems
- Provide guidance on compliance with the AI Act
- Allow testing under real-world conditions
- Include specific provisions for SMEs and startups

These sandboxes are compliance-focused—helping developers understand how to meet AI Act requirements rather than exempting them from requirements.

### UK AI Regulatory Sandbox

The UK has promoted sandbox approaches as part of its "pro-innovation" AI strategy:

- Sector-specific sandboxes (financial services, healthcare)
- Cross-sector coordination mechanisms
- Focus on enabling beneficial AI while managing risk
- Integration with broader regulatory experimentation

### Singapore's AI Sandbox

Singapore has used sandbox approaches for AI in financial services:

- Clear application criteria
- Predefined experimentation periods
- Regular reporting requirements
- Pathway to full deployment upon successful completion

### Sector-Specific Sandboxes

Beyond general AI sandboxes, sector-specific approaches exist:

- **Healthcare AI:** Expedited review pathways for AI medical devices
- **Financial services AI:** Sandbox arrangements for algorithmic trading, credit decisions
- **Autonomous vehicles:** Graduated testing frameworks with expanding scope

## What Makes Sandboxes Work

Evidence from existing sandboxes suggests success factors.

### Regulator Capacity

Sandboxes require regulatory resources. Intensive oversight, technical assessment, and ongoing engagement demand staff time and expertise. Under-resourced sandboxes become rubber stamps rather than learning opportunities.

This connects to our analysis of [regulatory capacity](/research/018-regulation-is-hard/)—governance requires institutional investment, not just legal authority.

### Genuine Learning Orientation

Sandboxes work when regulators actually use the experience to develop better rules. If sandbox participation simply delays regulation without informing it, the benefit is illusory.

### Balanced Participation

Sandbox benefits should be accessible to diverse participants, not just well-resourced incumbents. If only large companies can navigate sandbox requirements, sandboxes may increase rather than decrease market concentration.

### Clear Conditions

Participants need certainty about what the sandbox allows and requires. Vague conditions create uncertainty that undermines the sandbox's value.

### Exit Planning

Sandboxes should begin with clear exit expectations. Without planned transitions, sandbox participants may be stranded when participation ends.

## Limitations and Risks

Sandboxes are not governance solutions—they're governance tools with significant limitations.

### Regulatory Capture

Close relationships between regulators and sandbox participants can lead to capture. Regulators may become advocates for industries they're supposed to oversee, or may develop rules that favor incumbent participants.

### Delay Tactics

Sandboxes can be used strategically to delay regulation. Industries may advocate for sandbox approaches precisely to avoid real governance, using sandbox "experimentation" indefinitely.

### Unfair Advantage

Sandbox participants gain competitive advantages—they can do things competitors cannot. This may be intentional (rewarding innovation) but can also be arbitrary (rewarding well-connected firms).

### Limited Representativeness

Sandbox conditions are artificial. Success in a sandbox doesn't guarantee success—or safety—at full scale. Harms that only emerge with widespread deployment won't appear in limited trials.

### Gaming

Sophisticated participants may behave differently during sandbox observation than they would in full deployment, showing better behavior when watched.

### Scalability

Sandboxes work for a small number of participants. AI governance may need to address thousands of applications. Case-by-case sandbox assessment doesn't scale.

## When Sandboxes Make Sense for AI

Given these considerations, sandboxes are most appropriate when:

**Regulatory uncertainty is genuine.** If regulators already know what rules should apply, sandboxes are unnecessary. If rules genuinely need development, sandboxes can help.

**Stakes are manageable.** For high-stakes applications—AI in critical infrastructure, healthcare, criminal justice—sandbox limitations may not provide adequate protection. For lower-stakes applications, sandbox experimentation is safer.

**Participants are cooperative.** Sandboxes require good-faith participation. If participants aim to evade rather than develop governance, sandboxes enable rather than prevent harm.

**Regulators have capacity.** Under-resourced regulators shouldn't offer sandboxes they can't properly oversee.

**Exit pathways exist.** Sandbox participation should lead somewhere—to standard compliance, to new rules, or to prohibition. Indefinite sandboxing is regulatory abdication.

## Integration with Other Governance

Sandboxes work best as part of comprehensive governance, not as standalone measures.

**Baseline rules.** Some requirements should apply universally, with no sandbox exemption. Our analysis of [red lines](/research/004-red-lines-taxonomy/) identifies constraints that should be non-negotiable.

**Graduated deployment.** Sandboxes can be one tier in graduated deployment frameworks—limited trials, expanded pilots, full deployment, each with increasing requirements.

**Monitoring infrastructure.** Sandbox oversight can test monitoring approaches that later become standard requirements.

**International coordination.** Sandboxes in different jurisdictions should share information to avoid duplicative experimentation and regulatory arbitrage.

## Conclusion

Regulatory sandboxes are a potentially valuable tool for AI governance—enabling experimentation, generating learning, and bridging gaps between innovation and regulation.

But they're tools, not solutions. Effective sandboxes require substantial regulatory investment, genuine learning orientation, and integration with broader governance frameworks. Poorly designed sandboxes can delay governance, enable harms, and undermine public trust.

The question isn't whether to use sandboxes, but how to design them well and integrate them appropriately into comprehensive AI governance.
