## Two Modes of Governance

AI governance operates through two fundamentally different modes.

**Hard law** refers to binding legal requirements—statutes, regulations, and enforceable rules. Violations can be prosecuted and punished. The EU AI Act is hard law.

**Soft law** refers to non-binding guidance—principles, guidelines, voluntary commitments, and best practices. Compliance is encouraged but not compelled. Corporate AI ethics principles are soft law.

Both approaches are extensively used in AI governance. Understanding their tradeoffs is essential for effective governance design.

## The Case for Hard Law

Binding legal requirements have several advantages.

### Enforceability

Hard law can be enforced. Companies that violate requirements face penalties—fines, operational restrictions, or criminal liability. This creates strong incentives for compliance that don't depend on voluntary cooperation.

As we discussed in [self-reporting versus audit](/research/010-self-reporting-vs-audit/), voluntary measures are systematically limited. Hard law addresses situations where commercial incentives diverge from public interest.

### Equality

Hard law applies equally to all covered actors. Responsible companies don't face competitive disadvantage from following rules that competitors ignore. This prevents races to the bottom.

### Democratic Legitimacy

Legislation emerges from democratic processes with established accountability. Elected representatives debate and vote; courts interpret. This provides legitimacy that private governance lacks.

### Clarity

Legal requirements are typically more specific than guidance. Companies know what they must do. Regulators know what to enforce. Affected parties know what protections they have.

### Remedies

Hard law provides remedies for harm. When AI systems cause injury, legal liability enables compensation. Soft law offers no such recourse.

## The Case for Soft Law

Non-binding approaches also have significant advantages.

### Speed

Legislation takes years. Soft law can be developed in months or even weeks. For rapidly evolving technology, this speed matters. By the time comprehensive AI legislation is enacted, the technology may have changed significantly.

### Flexibility

Soft law can adapt to diverse circumstances. Guidelines can be interpreted contextually; principles can accommodate edge cases. Legal requirements, especially detailed ones, may fit some situations poorly.

### Experimentation

Soft law allows experimentation with governance approaches. If guidelines don't work, they can be revised without the difficulty of amending legislation. This enables learning.

### Expertise Integration

Soft law often emerges from expert communities—AI researchers, industry practitioners, ethicists. It can incorporate technical knowledge that legislative processes struggle to access.

### International Reach

Soft law can apply across jurisdictions where binding international law is difficult to achieve. Industry associations, standards bodies, and professional communities can coordinate globally even without treaties.

### Relationship Building

Developing soft law creates ongoing dialogue between regulators, industry, and civil society. This builds relationships and shared understanding that can improve both governance and compliance.

## When Each Works

Neither hard nor soft law is universally superior. Each works better in different circumstances.

### Hard Law Is Better When:

**Stakes are high.** When AI applications can cause serious harm—healthcare, criminal justice, critical infrastructure—binding requirements with enforcement are appropriate. Voluntary compliance isn't adequate for life-and-death decisions.

**Competitive dynamics favor harm.** When market pressure pushes toward harmful practices, hard law levels the playing field. If data harvesting is profitable and privacy protection isn't, privacy requires legal protection.

**Victims need recourse.** When AI causes injury, victims need enforceable rights and remedies. Soft law provides none.

**Actors are uncooperative.** Voluntary approaches only work with willing participants. Some actors require legal compulsion.

**Distributional justice matters.** Who bears AI's costs and benefits is ultimately a political question requiring democratic resolution, not private agreement.

### Soft Law Is Better When:

**Knowledge is limited.** When regulators don't yet know what rules should apply, soft law enables experimentation. Premature binding rules may lock in bad approaches.

**Technology is changing rapidly.** For fast-moving areas, adaptable guidelines may govern more effectively than rigid statutes.

**International coordination is needed.** When binding treaties aren't achievable, soft law can provide cross-border coordination.

**Industry has aligned incentives.** When responsible behavior is also profitable—perhaps because it builds trust—voluntary approaches may be effective.

**Regulatory capacity is limited.** Enforcement requires resources. Where regulatory capacity is constrained, soft law might be more realistic than ambitious but unenforced hard law.

## The Interaction

Hard and soft law don't exist in isolation—they interact in important ways.

### Soft Law as Precursor

Soft law often precedes hard law. Industry guidelines become codified as regulations. International principles become treaty obligations. Experimentation with soft approaches informs eventual legislation.

The progression from AI ethics principles (2016-2019) to the EU AI Act (2024) illustrates this pattern.

### Soft Law Filling Gaps

Legislation cannot anticipate every situation. Soft law fills gaps—providing guidance where statutes are silent or ambiguous. Standards bodies develop specifications that implement legislative requirements.

We examined this relationship in [the role of standards bodies](/research/039-standards-bodies/).

### Hard Law Backstop

Soft law often works because hard law threatens. Voluntary commitments are more credible when failure might trigger regulation. The "shadow of hierarchy" makes self-governance viable.

### Implementation Through Soft Law

Hard law sets requirements; soft law often specifies compliance methods. The EU AI Act requires risk management; standards specify what risk management entails.

### Tension and Conflict

Sometimes soft and hard law conflict. Industry guidance might set lower standards than what legislation requires. Or guidance might exceed legal requirements, creating uncertainty about actual obligations.

## AI-Specific Considerations

AI governance presents particular challenges for choosing between hard and soft law.

### Capability Uncertainty

We don't fully understand what current AI systems can do, let alone future systems. This uncertainty argues for soft law's flexibility—but high-stakes applications may not tolerate the ambiguity.

This relates to [the capability overhang problem](/research/009-capability-overhang/): risks exist but aren't fully known.

### Corporate Concentration

AI development is concentrated among few actors. This makes voluntary agreements more feasible—fewer participants to coordinate. But it also increases concern about capture and inadequate accountability.

### Technical Complexity

Effective AI governance requires technical expertise that legislative processes may lack. This argues for expert-developed soft law—but creates accountability concerns about who the experts serve.

### Global Reach

AI systems operate globally; legislation is national. Soft law's international reach is valuable, but may not adequately protect those in less-regulated jurisdictions.

### Speed of Change

AI develops faster than legislative processes. By the time comprehensive laws are enacted, they may be obsolete. But waiting for "the right moment" for legislation may mean waiting indefinitely.

## Design Implications

Given these tradeoffs, effective AI governance likely requires both hard and soft law, thoughtfully integrated.

### Tiered Approaches

Use hard law for high-stakes applications and core rights protections. Use soft law for emerging areas, implementation guidance, and international coordination.

The EU AI Act's tiered structure—with prohibited applications, high-risk requirements, and lighter-touch transparency obligations—illustrates this approach.

### Escalation Mechanisms

Soft law should include triggers for escalation to hard law. If voluntary approaches fail, binding requirements should follow. Sunset provisions on soft law can force reassessment.

### Standard-Legislation Integration

Standards should be developed in coordination with legislation, not as alternatives. Our analysis of [standards governance](/research/039-standards-bodies/) explores this relationship.

### Accountability Layering

Combine mechanisms: legal requirements for minimum standards, soft law for aspirational practices, and market mechanisms for incentives. Redundancy provides resilience.

### Stakeholder Inclusion

Both hard and soft law development should include affected communities, not just industry experts and regulators. Democratic legitimacy matters for both.

## Conclusion

Hard and soft law offer different strengths for AI governance. Hard law provides enforceability, equality, and democratic legitimacy but is slow, rigid, and resource-intensive. Soft law provides speed, flexibility, and expertise integration but lacks enforcement, may be captured, and provides no remedies.

Effective AI governance requires both, integrated thoughtfully. Core rights and high-stakes applications warrant hard law. Emerging areas and implementation details benefit from soft law. The challenge is designing governance systems that capture the advantages of each while managing their limitations.
