## The Attention Assumption

AI governance frameworks assume human oversight. Humans review decisions. Humans approve deployments. Humans catch errors. Humans intervene when something goes wrong.

This assumption contains a hidden premise: that humans are actually paying attention.

Attention is a scarce resource. Modern digital environments specifically capture and monetize that resource. Every notification, every infinite scroll, every variable reward schedule competes for the same cognitive bandwidth that governance requires.

What happens when the interfaces we use for oversight are shaped by the same attention-extracting dynamics that define the rest of the digital environment?

## How Attention Extraction Works

The attention economy operates through several mechanisms.

**Variable reward schedules.** Unpredictable rewards (sometimes a notification is interesting, sometimes not) create compulsive checking behavior. This is slot machine psychology applied to interfaces.

**Social validation signals.** Likes, comments, and reactions provide intermittent social feedback that humans are wired to find compelling.

**Infinite scroll.** No natural stopping points means no natural moments to disengage and reflect.

**Notification systems.** Interruptions fragment attention and make sustained focus difficult.

**Engagement optimization.** Machine learning systems fine-tune every element to maximize time-on-platform, not comprehension or good decision-making.

These mechanisms are well-documented. What is less discussed is how they affect governance contexts where sustained attention is essential.

## Governance Requires a Different Kind of Attention

Effective oversight requires:

**Sustained focus.** Reviewing a risk assessment or audit report takes uninterrupted concentration. Context-switching degrades comprehension.

**Critical evaluation.** Governance is not consumption. It requires skepticism, questioning, and active engagement with material.

**Calibrated judgment.** Decision-makers need accurate mental models of risks and trade-offs. Rushed or distracted evaluation produces miscalibrated judgments.

**Anomaly detection.** Catching problems requires noticing when something is wrong. Distraction makes anomalies invisible.

These requirements are in direct tension with interfaces optimized for engagement. An interface that maximizes time-on-platform does not maximize careful evaluation. An interface that fragments attention does not support sustained focus.

## Where This Shows Up

Consider several governance contexts:

**Compliance dashboards.** Many AI governance tools present information through dashboards. Dashboards can be designed for quick scanning (useful) or for impressive visual complexity (not useful). [Transparency requirements](/research/019-eu-ai-act-gaps/) often produce documentation that satisfies legal obligations without enabling genuine understanding.

**Alert systems.** Systems that flag potential problems generate alerts. Too many alerts produce alert fatigue: users stop paying attention to any of them. The signal drowns in noise.

**Audit interfaces.** External auditors reviewing AI systems need interfaces designed for investigative work. If those interfaces are designed for developers who already understand the system, auditors cannot use them effectively.

**Regulatory filings.** Reviews of AI system registrations, risk assessments, and compliance documentation are often performed through generic document review interfaces not designed for the specific cognitive demands of governance.

The common problem: interfaces designed without attention to attention.

## Design Principles for Governance Interfaces

If attention is a scarce resource that governance consumes, interfaces should be designed to conserve it.

**Minimize interruptions.** Governance interfaces should not have notifications, alerts for unrelated systems, or other interruption sources. Focus requires protection from fragmentation.

**Create natural stopping points.** Unlike infinite scroll, governance interfaces should structure work into discrete units with clear endpoints. Each unit should be completable in a reasonable time.

**Prioritize signal.** Not all information is equally important. Interfaces should foreground critical information and background routine details. [Proportionality](/research/001-proportionality-disclosure/) applies to information presentation, not just regulatory requirements.

**Support comparison.** Governance often involves comparing current state to expected state, or current system to similar systems. Interfaces should make comparison easy rather than forcing users to hold information in memory.

**Make anomalies visible.** If the purpose of oversight is catching problems, interfaces should make problems visible. Color coding, deviation highlighting, and exception reporting should be default behaviors.

**Reduce cognitive load.** Every unnecessary choice, every confusing layout, every ambiguous label consumes cognitive resources. Governance interfaces should be ruthlessly simplified.

**Design for skepticism.** Engagement-optimized interfaces are designed to reduce friction and encourage continuation. Governance interfaces should encourage pausing, questioning, and second-guessing.

## Institutional Implications

Interface design is not just a technical problem. It has institutional dimensions.

**Procurement.** Organizations procure governance tools based on feature lists and demos, not systematic evaluation of attention demands. This should change.

**Training.** Users can be trained in attention management: how to structure work sessions, when to take breaks, how to recognize attention degradation. But this training is rarely provided.

**Workload.** If each review takes longer than the organization budgets, reviewers will rush. Workload must be calibrated to the actual cognitive demands of the work.

**Accountability.** If reviewers face no consequences for superficial review, they will review superficially. Accountability structures should reward quality, not just throughput.

**Tool evaluation.** Organizations should assess governance tools for attention demands, not just functionality. Does this tool fragment attention? Does it produce alert fatigue? Does it support sustained focus?

## The Reflexive Connection

Reflexive governance offers partial mitigation.

If AI systems can [explain their constraints](/research/026-explaining-constraints/) clearly, reviewers do not need to reconstruct this information from raw data. If systems [communicate uncertainty](/research/027-uncertainty-communication/) explicitly, reviewers can focus attention on uncertain cases. If systems [detect their own misuse](/research/011-reflexive-misuse-detection/) and flag anomalies, human attention can be directed to genuine problems rather than distributed across everything.

The goal is not to replace human attention with automated systems. It is to use automated systems to focus human attention where it is most needed.

This is the opposite of the attention economy's logic. Instead of capturing and monetizing attention, reflexive governance conserves attention for high-value uses.

## Conclusion

Human oversight of AI systems is undermined when the interfaces for that oversight are designed by the same logic that undermines attention elsewhere.

Governance-specific interface design is a research and practice gap. We have extensive knowledge about how to capture attention. We have much less knowledge about how to support the kind of sustained, critical, calibrated attention that governance requires.

Filling this gap requires recognizing attention as a governance resource: something that can be wasted or conserved, fragmented or protected, exploited or respected.

AI governance frameworks that mandate human oversight without attending to the conditions that make oversight possible will produce governance theater: the appearance of oversight without its substance.
