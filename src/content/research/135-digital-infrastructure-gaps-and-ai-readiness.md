*Type: Policy Analysis & AI-Focused Assessment*

## Introduction

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has spurred intense debate about their transformative potential. However, the realization of this potential depends on robust and equitable digital infrastructure. "AI readiness"—the ability of a nation, organization, or community to effectively adopt and govern AI systems—is inexorably tied to the quality, availability, and inclusivity of its digital infrastructure. Yet, significant gaps in this infrastructure persist, both within and between nations, creating asymmetries in preparedness that exacerbate existing inequalities and introduce systemic risks.

This article examines the relationship between digital infrastructure gaps and AI readiness, with a focus on three dimensions: technological capacity, governance frameworks, and socio-economic equity. Drawing on examples from both high-income and low-income contexts, as well as cross-referencing related research, we outline the implications of these gaps for global AI governance and propose pathways for closing them.

## The Foundations of AI Readiness

AI readiness is a multi-faceted concept encompassing technical, regulatory, and social dimensions. At its core, it requires:

1. **Technological Capacity**: This includes access to computing resources, high-speed internet connectivity, and data storage capabilities. Advanced AI systems, such as large language models (LLMs), demand immense computational power, which is often concentrated in only a few regions globally.
2. **Regulatory Frameworks**: Effective AI deployment requires clear guidelines on data privacy, security, and accountability. Without these, AI adoption can lead to unintended harms ranging from algorithmic bias to data breaches.
3. **Human Capital**: Skilled labor is critical for training, deploying, and maintaining AI systems. This includes not only technical expertise but also governance know-how.

However, these foundational elements are unevenly distributed. High-income countries dominate the AI landscape, while low-income nations struggle with basic digital infrastructure. For example, a 2025 report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) noted that nearly 3 billion people globally still lack internet access, disproportionately affecting regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and rural South Asia. This digital divide is both a cause and a consequence of disparities in AI readiness.

## Digital Infrastructure Gaps: A Global Perspective

### High-Income Countries: The Illusion of Readiness

Even in high-income nations, digital infrastructure gaps manifest in subtle but significant ways. While countries like the United States, Germany, and Japan lead in AI development, challenges such as aging broadband networks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and uneven rural-urban connectivity persist. For example, the United States has made strides with its National AI Initiative, yet rural broadband access remains a critical bottleneck for equitable AI deployment. According to a 2024 report by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), approximately 14 million Americans still lack access to high-speed internet, limiting their ability to engage with AI-driven tools and services.

Moreover, over-reliance on private cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud raises questions about digital sovereignty. As discussed in [Digital Sovereignty and AI Infrastructure](/research/110-digital-sovereignty-and-ai-infrastructure), the centralization of key digital resources in the hands of a few corporations creates systemic risks, including potential monopolistic practices and geopolitical vulnerabilities.

### Low-Income Countries: The Struggle for Basic Access

For low-income nations, the challenges are more fundamental. Limited access to electricity, outdated telecommunications networks, and low levels of digital literacy create significant barriers to AI readiness. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa, home to 1.2 billion people, accounts for less than 1% of global AI research output. This disparity is not merely a reflection of resource constraints but also of systemic neglect in global technology governance.

In addition, low-resource languages remain underrepresented in AI systems, as explored in [Language Model Bias Against Low-Resource Languages](/research/134-language-model-bias-against-low-resource-languages). The lack of digital infrastructure to collect and process linguistic data in these regions further entrenches their exclusion from AI advancements.

### The Role of Emerging Technologies

Emerging technologies such as satellite-based internet (e.g., Starlink) and decentralized computing platforms offer potential solutions to digital infrastructure gaps. However, these technologies are not without their challenges. High costs, regulatory hurdles, and potential environmental impacts may limit their scalability and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

## Risks of Uneven AI Readiness

The uneven distribution of digital infrastructure has profound implications for global AI governance. Key risks include:

1. **Exacerbation of Inequality**: Disparities in AI readiness can widen existing socio-economic gaps. For example, countries with robust digital infrastructure are better positioned to attract AI investments, leading to a concentration of economic and technological power.
2. **Geopolitical Tensions**: The centralization of AI capabilities in a few nations can exacerbate global power imbalances. This is particularly concerning in the context of dual-use technologies, as highlighted in [The Biosecurity Dilemma of Open-Weight Agents](/research/108-the-biosecurity-dilemma-of-open-weight-agents).
3. **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Inconsistent digital infrastructure and governance frameworks enable regulatory arbitrage, where AI developers exploit weaker jurisdictions to avoid compliance. This undermines global efforts to establish comprehensive AI safety standards.

## Pathways to Address Digital Infrastructure Gaps

### Investment in Digital Public Goods

One of the most effective ways to address infrastructure gaps is through investment in digital public goods, such as open-source software, open data repositories, and universal broadband access. Public-private partnerships can play a critical role in mobilizing resources for these initiatives. For example, the World Bank’s Digital Development Partnership has successfully funded projects to expand internet access in low-income countries.

### Capacity-Building Initiatives

Closing the digital divide also requires investments in human capital. Capacity-building programs that focus on digital literacy, technical training, and governance expertise are essential. Retraining programs, such as those discussed in [Retraining Programs for AI-Displaced Workers: What Works](/research/123-retraining-programs-for-ai-displaced-workers-what), provide a useful model for developing the skills needed to support AI readiness.

### International Cooperation

Given the global nature of AI risks and opportunities, international cooperation is critical. Frameworks such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) should be expanded to include provisions for infrastructure sharing, technology transfer, and equitable funding mechanisms.

### Regulatory Harmonization

Harmonizing regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions can reduce the risks of regulatory arbitrage and ensure a level playing field. This includes establishing minimum standards for data privacy, cybersecurity, and algorithmic accountability, as well as mechanisms for cross-border collaboration.

## Conclusion

Digital infrastructure gaps represent a significant barrier to AI readiness, with implications for economic competitiveness, social equity, and global security. Addressing these gaps requires a multi-pronged approach that includes investments in digital public goods, capacity-building initiatives, international cooperation, and regulatory harmonization. While the challenges are formidable, they are not insurmountable. By prioritizing equitable and inclusive infrastructure development, we can ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed more fairly, avoiding a future characterized by deepening divides.

Further research is needed to explore the technical dimensions of infrastructure deployment in low-resource contexts.*
