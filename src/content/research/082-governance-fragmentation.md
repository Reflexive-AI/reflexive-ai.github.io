## The Crowded Landscape

Count the AI governance frameworks. The EU AI Act. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework. OECD AI Principles. The Bletchley Declaration. IEEE standards. ISO standards. Industry commitments. Academic proposals. Civil society guidelines. National strategies from dozens of countries.

The list grows weekly. Each new framework promises structure, clarity, and guidance. Each adds to the pile that practitioners must somehow navigate.

This is governance fragmentation: not absence of governance but excessive, uncoordinated, potentially contradictory governance. The problem is not that no one is governing AI but that everyone is, differently.

## Why Fragmentation Happens

Fragmentation has understandable causes.

### Jurisdiction

Different jurisdictions have authority over their territories. The EU regulates for Europe. The US regulates for America. China regulates for China. No one has global authority.

This produces legitimate variation. Democratic polities may regulate differently based on different values. This is not failure but pluralism.

But it creates navigation challenges for global actors.

### Institutions

Within jurisdictions, multiple institutions claim relevance. Data protection authorities, competition regulators, sector-specific agencies, and legislatures all assert roles.

Each institution brings its expertise and perspective. Each also brings territorial behavior and coordination failures.

### Stakeholders

Different stakeholders propose frameworks reflecting their interests. Industry frameworks emphasize innovation and self-regulation. Civil society frameworks emphasize rights and accountability. Academic frameworks emphasize rigor and research agenda.

This diversity provides input. It also produces proliferation.

### Novelty and Uncertainty

AI governance is new. No one knows the right answer. Different actors experiment with different approaches. This experimentation is valuable until synthesis becomes possible.

But synthesis is slow. Experimentation continues indefinitely.

### Signaling

Launching a framework signals engagement. Organizations and governments release frameworks partly to demonstrate they are doing something. The content matters less than the demonstration.

This creates incentives for proliferation even when marginal frameworks add little value.

## Costs of Fragmentation

Fragmentation has costs.

### Compliance Burden

Organizations must navigate multiple overlapping frameworks. Compliance resources are spent understanding which frameworks apply, how they differ, and how to satisfy all simultaneously.

[Small actors face disproportionate burden](/research/075-small-actor-problem/). Large organizations can hire teams to manage complexity. Small organizations cannot.

### Gaps and Contradictions

Frameworks may contradict each other. One may require disclosure another prohibits. One may encourage practices another deems risky.

Even without contradiction, coverage may be uneven. Critical issues may fall between frameworks, unaddressed by any.

### Forum Shopping

Actors can choose which frameworks to invoke, emphasizing favorable ones and ignoring unfavorable ones. This is not compliance but selective framing.

[Regulatory arbitrage](/research/008-regulatory-arbitrage/) operates within as well as between jurisdictions when multiple frameworks offer different constraints.

### Shallow Implementation

When too many frameworks demand attention, each receives shallow implementation. Organizations satisfy formal requirements without substantive engagement.

Resources spread thin produce compliance theater rather than meaningful governance.

### Confusion

Outsiders, including the public, cannot understand a fragmented landscape. If experts cannot articulate which frameworks matter and how they relate, trust in governance itself erodes.

## Approaches to Coherence

How might we achieve coherence without premature standardization?

### Mapping and Comparison

Before synthesis, we need understanding. Systematic mapping of frameworks, identifying overlaps, gaps, and contradictions, provides foundation for coherence.

Several organizations attempt this: surveys of AI principles, comparative analyses of regulations, crosswalk documents relating different frameworks.

Such mapping is valuable but does not itself produce coherence.

### Hierarchy and Layering

Some frameworks could be positioned as base layers while others add specificity. International principles might establish floor requirements. National regulations might add detail. Industry standards might operationalize further.

This layering requires agreement on what belongs at which level, which is contested.

### Mutual Recognition

Jurisdictions and institutions could recognize each other's frameworks as equivalent for certain purposes. If Framework A accepts Framework B compliance as satisfying its requirements, actors need not duplicate effort.

Mutual recognition requires trust and negotiation. It often proceeds bilaterally rather than comprehensively.

### Interoperability Standards

Rather than unifying frameworks, standards could enable interoperability. Common vocabularies, shared definitions, and translation protocols would allow frameworks to communicate while retaining differences.

[Machine-readable constraint schemas](/research/003-machine-readable-constraint-schema/) could enable automated translation between framework requirements.

### Meta-Governance

Institutions could govern the governance landscape itself: coordinating framework development, identifying redundancy, facilitating synthesis.

This is governance of governance, or meta-governance. It requires authority that no institution currently has.

### Market and Reputation Pressures

If practitioners converge on certain frameworks because they are useful, less useful frameworks will fade. Market selection for usefulness can produce de facto standardization without formal coordination.

This assumes practitioners can evaluate usefulness, which may not hold when frameworks are new.

## Risks of Premature Standardization

Fragmentation is costly, but premature standardization has risks too.

**Lock-in to wrong approaches.** If we standardize before understanding what works, we may lock in errors. Early standards may reflect initial assumptions that later prove incorrect.

**Reduced experimentation.** Standardization discourages alternatives. If different approaches might work better for different contexts, standardization forecloses learning.

**Power dynamics.** Standardization processes favor those who participate. Powerful actors shape standards to their advantage. Standardization may entrench power rather than serve broad interests.

**Lag behind technology.** AI evolves faster than governance. Standards appropriate for today's systems may not suit tomorrow's. Standardization freezes governance where flexibility may be needed.

The goal is not maximizing standardization but finding the appropriate level of coordination for current understanding.

## A Practical Path

Given costs of fragmentation and risks of standardization, what is practical?

### Provisional Synthesis

Create synthesis documents that relate major frameworks without replacing them. These documents would identify: what frameworks require, how requirements relate, where requirements conflict, and how conflicts might be resolved.

Synthesis would be provisional: updated as frameworks evolve and understanding improves.

### Convergence on Essentials

Identify core requirements where convergence is possible. Basic disclosure, defined risk assessment processes, minimum documentation might be achievable even while detail varies.

Convergence on essentials provides coherence without full standardization.

### Modular Compliance

Design compliance systems that can satisfy multiple frameworks modularly. One documentation approach might fulfill several framework requirements with minimal adaptation.

This reduces burden without requiring frameworks themselves to merge.

### Active Coordination

Create venues where framework developers coordinate actively. Not merging organizations but ensuring new frameworks connect to existing ones.

Something like this exists in various forums but is underdeveloped.

### Periodic Consolidation

Build in periodic review where the landscape is assessed and redundant frameworks retired. Sunset clauses for experimental frameworks. Consolidation moments where multiple frameworks merge.

This requires discipline that fragmented stakeholders may not accept.

## Reflexive Application

The Reflexive AI Initiative should apply this analysis to itself.

This initiative is one framework among many. It may contribute to fragmentation rather than reducing it. The machine-readable constraint schema, the reflexive governance principles, the research articles, all add to what practitioners must navigate.

What would it mean to pursue coherence rather than proliferation?

- Connect explicitly to other frameworks rather than standing alone
- Identify where reflexive principles overlap with existing approaches
- Refrain from reinventing what exists adequately elsewhere
- Support synthesis efforts rather than competitive positioning

Practicing what we analyze requires discipline.

## Conclusion

AI governance fragmentation is real and costly. But it also reflects legitimate pluralism, useful experimentation, and the novelty of the governance challenge.

The path forward is neither accepting fragmentation indefinitely nor forcing premature standardization. It is iterative synthesis: mapping, coordinating, converging on essentials, and building interoperability while preserving space for continued learning.

Those creating frameworks, including this initiative, bear responsibility for contributing to coherence rather than chaos.
