## Why Boards Must Engage

Corporate boards have fiduciary duties to shareholders and, increasingly, responsibilities to other stakeholders. AI raises governance issues that demand board attention:

**Strategic significance.** AI may be central to corporate strategy. Boards must understand AI opportunities and risks to fulfill their strategic oversight role.

**Material risk.** AI can create material risks—regulatory, reputational, operational, and legal. Boards are responsible for risk oversight.

**Liability exposure.** Directors may face personal liability for AI-related harms if they fail to exercise appropriate oversight.

**Stakeholder expectations.** Investors, regulators, and public increasingly expect board engagement with AI governance.

Many boards are not adequately equipped for this oversight. This analysis provides practical guidance for boards seeking to improve AI oversight.

## Current State of Board AI Oversight

Board engagement with AI varies widely.

**Minimal engagement.** Many boards treat AI as a technical matter delegated to management, receiving occasional briefings but not exercising substantive oversight.

**Risk-focused.** Some boards engage with AI primarily through risk committees, focusing on compliance and liability rather than broader governance.

**Strategic focus.** Some boards engage with AI as strategic opportunity, potentially under-weighting risk considerations.

**Integrated oversight.** A minority of boards have developed comprehensive AI oversight integrating strategy, risk, ethics, and operations.

Research suggests that most boards are in the first two categories—insufficient engagement for the significance of AI in their organizations.

## The Knowledge Gap

A fundamental challenge is the knowledge gap between AI capabilities and board expertise.

**Technical complexity.** AI systems are technically complex. Most directors lack backgrounds in machine learning, data science, or related fields.

**Rapid change.** AI capabilities change faster than boards can develop expertise. Knowledge acquired one year may be outdated the next.

**Jargon barriers.** AI discourse is full of jargon that obscures rather than illuminates. Boards may not know enough to ask good questions.

**Information asymmetry.** Management controls information flow to boards. Directors dependent on management briefings may not receive complete or balanced information.

Addressing this knowledge gap is essential for effective oversight.

## Building Board Capacity

Several approaches can build board capacity for AI oversight.

### Board Composition

**AI expertise on board.** Consider adding directors with AI expertise—former CTOs, AI researchers, or technology policy experts. Expertise need not be technical; understanding of AI governance and risk is valuable.

**Board education.** Provide ongoing education for all directors on AI developments, risks, and governance. This should be regular and substantive, not occasional briefings.

**External advisors.** Engage external advisors to provide independent perspective and compensate for board knowledge gaps.

### Committee Structure

**AI committee.** Some organizations have established dedicated AI or technology committees. These provide focused attention but may silo AI oversight from broader governance.

**Integrated approach.** Alternatively, integrate AI oversight into existing committees: risk committees address AI risk, audit committees address AI controls, compensation committees address AI's incentive implications.

**Full board engagement.** Given AI's significance, full board engagement is often appropriate, with committees handling detailed work.

### Information Flow

**Direct access.** Ensure board has access to AI and safety leadership, not just senior management. This parallels requirements for audit committee access to internal audit.

**Balanced reporting.** Require reporting that includes risks and failures, not just successes. Create channels for concerns to reach the board.

**External perspectives.** Include external perspectives in board materials—regulatory developments, competitor practices, expert assessments.

**Key metrics.** Develop metrics that board can monitor: incident rates, safety investment, capability assessments, regulatory compliance status.

## What Boards Should Oversee

Board AI oversight should cover several areas.

### Strategy

**AI strategy alignment.** Does AI strategy align with overall corporate strategy? Is the company investing appropriately in AI?

**Competitive positioning.** How does the company's AI capability compare to competitors? What are the strategic implications?

**Long-term implications.** What are the long-term implications of AI investments? How might AI transform the business?

### Risk

**Risk identification.** What AI-related risks exist? Regulatory, reputational, operational, legal, ethical?

**Risk assessment.** How significant are these risks? What is the potential magnitude and likelihood?

**Risk mitigation.** What controls are in place? Are they adequate?

**Emerging risks.** What new risks are emerging as AI capabilities advance?

Our analysis of [capability overhang](/research/capability-overhang/) is relevant—risks may exist that aren't yet apparent.

### Ethics and Safety

**Ethical framework.** What ethical principles guide AI development and deployment? Are they substantive and operational?

**Safety practices.** What safety practices are in place? How do they compare to industry standards and regulatory requirements?

**Incident handling.** How are AI incidents identified, assessed, and addressed? What is the track record?

**Stakeholder impact.** How do AI systems affect customers, employees, and communities? What safeguards exist?

### Compliance

**Regulatory compliance.** Is the company compliant with applicable AI regulations? What is the compliance posture for emerging regulations like the EU AI Act?

**Disclosure requirements.** Are AI-related disclosures adequate? Are there material AI risks that should be disclosed?

**Audit and assurance.** Is there adequate internal audit coverage of AI? Are third-party assessments appropriate?

### Governance Structure

**Organizational responsibility.** Who is responsible for AI governance within management? Is the structure adequate?

**Authority and accountability.** Do safety and ethics functions have adequate authority? Is there clear accountability?

**Culture.** Does the organization have appropriate culture around AI safety? Are concerns raised and addressed?

We examined organizational governance in [corporate governance structures for AI safety](/research/corporate-governance/).

## Board Engagement Practices

Several practices can improve board engagement.

### Regular Reporting

**Cadence.** AI reporting should be regular—quarterly at minimum, more frequently for companies where AI is central.

**Depth.** Reports should provide substantive information, not just optimistic summaries. Include metrics, incidents, and challenges.

**Discussion time.** Allocate adequate time for discussion, not just presentation. Directors should have opportunity to probe.

### Site Visits and Demonstrations

**Technical immersion.** Board visits to AI development operations, with demonstrations of systems and explanation of processes, can build understanding.

**Culture observation.** Visits also allow directors to observe culture—how safety is discussed, whether concerns are raised openly.

### Scenario Analysis

**Risk scenarios.** Walk through scenarios of AI risks materializing. How would the company respond? Are response capabilities adequate?

**Strategic scenarios.** Consider scenarios of AI capability advancement. What opportunities and threats might emerge?

### External Engagement

**Regulator relationships.** Directors may engage with regulators to understand expectations and build relationships.

**Industry participation.** Participation in industry governance initiatives can provide perspective and build networks.

**Expert consultation.** Periodic consultation with external AI safety and governance experts provides independent perspective.

### Executive Sessions

**Management-free discussion.** Executive sessions without management allow directors to discuss concerns candidly and assess management performance.

**Safety leadership access.** Consider occasional executive sessions with AI safety leadership, without product executives present.

## Red Flags

Certain signs suggest inadequate board AI oversight:

- No director with AI-relevant expertise or experience
- AI briefings limited to commercial opportunities, not risks
- No metrics for AI safety or governance
- Board unaware of AI incidents that have occurred
- Safety concerns not reaching board level
- Management controls all AI information flow to board
- No discussion of AI in risk oversight
- Ethical principles exist but are never discussed

## Emerging Expectations

Expectations for board AI oversight are increasing:

**Regulatory pressure.** Regulators increasingly expect board engagement with AI governance. The EU AI Act's governance requirements will likely extend to board level.

**Investor expectations.** Institutional investors increasingly ask about AI governance. Board oversight will become standard expectation.

**Litigation risk.** Director liability for AI failures may increase, creating incentives for demonstrable oversight.

**Disclosure requirements.** AI governance disclosure requirements are emerging, requiring boards to articulate their oversight practices.

Boards that develop effective oversight now will be better positioned as expectations formalize.

## Conclusion

Board-level AI oversight is becoming essential. Boards need expertise, information, and engagement practices that enable effective oversight of AI strategy, risk, ethics, and governance.

This requires deliberate investment—in board composition, education, information flow, and engagement practices. Boards that treat AI as a purely technical matter delegated to management are failing their oversight responsibilities.

The stakes are high. AI-related failures can create material harm to companies and stakeholders. Effective board oversight is both a governance imperative and a risk management necessity.
