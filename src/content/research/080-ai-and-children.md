## A Distinct Population

Children are not small adults. This basic insight, established in developmental psychology and children's rights law, has not been adequately incorporated into AI governance.

Children have distinct vulnerabilities: developing brains, limited life experience, ongoing identity formation, dependency on adults. They also have distinct needs: education, play, protection, gradual autonomy.

AI systems designed for adult contexts, with adult reasoning and adult resilience assumed, may harm children in specific ways. This article explores what governance considerations are distinct when AI intersects with childhood.

## Where AI Meets Childhood

AI systems interact with children across many contexts.

### Education

AI tutoring systems, educational games, and homework helpers are marketed to families and schools. These systems promise personalized learning but raise questions about what children learn, how learning is optimized, and what data is collected.

The stakes are high. Educational experiences shape cognitive development, attitudes toward learning, and life trajectories. AI systems that optimize for engagement may not optimize for education.

### Content and Entertainment

Children consume vast amounts of algorithmically curated content. Recommendation systems on YouTube, TikTok, and gaming platforms shape what children see.

Content recommendation for children raises questions absent for adults. What is developmentally appropriate? What patterns of consumption are healthy? Who determines what children should see?

### Social Interaction

AI companions, chatbots, and social features affect how children develop social skills. Interaction with AI is not equivalent to interaction with humans.

Children learning to navigate relationships through AI interactions may develop differently than children learning through human relationships.

### Commercial Targeting

AI-powered advertising targets children, who are more susceptible to persuasion than adults. Dark patterns exploit cognitive vulnerabilities that children have in greater measure.

Commercial exploitation of children through AI-powered targeting raises ethical issues distinct from adult advertising.

### Surveillance

AI systems monitor children in homes, schools, and online spaces. Such surveillance may protect children from harm but also restricts autonomy and normalizes monitoring.

The appropriate balance between protection and privacy differs for children than for adults.

## What Makes Children Different

Several factors make children's interaction with AI distinct.

### Developmental Stages

Children's cognitive, emotional, and social capacities develop over time. A seven-year-old is not a twelve-year-old is not a seventeen-year-old.

AI systems designed for adults, or even for "children" as a monolithic category, may not account for developmental variation. Content appropriate for a teenager may harm a young child. Complexity manageable for a twelve-year-old may frustrate a seven-year-old.

### Identity Formation

Childhood involves identity formation. Children are developing self-concepts, values, and preferences. AI systems that shape these processes bear special responsibility.

Recommendation algorithms that create filter bubbles may have more lasting effects on children whose worldviews are still forming.

### Suggestibility

Children are more suggestible than adults. They are more likely to believe what authoritative sources tell them, less equipped to evaluate claims critically.

AI systems that present confident-seeming outputs may be particularly misleading to children who cannot evaluate reliability.

### Consent and Autonomy

Children cannot consent in the same way adults can. Parents provide proxy consent, but their interests may not perfectly align with children's.

Governance that relies on informed consent works poorly for children who cannot provide it.

### Vulnerability to Harm

Certain harms are more severe for children. Exposure to age-inappropriate content, manipulation by predatory actors, and data collection that follows children into adulthood all pose distinct risks.

Harms that adults might weather may cause lasting damage to children.

## Current Governance Gaps

Current AI governance does not adequately address children.

### Age Verification Failures

Systems that restrict content or features to adults typically employ age verification that children easily circumvent. Declaring a false birthday creates a legal fiction of adulthood without actual protection.

### One-Size-Fits-All Approaches

Regulations designed for adults may not protect children. GDPR has child-specific provisions, but many frameworks treat all users identically.

### Developmental Blindness

Categories like "child" or "minor" obscure developmental variation. A well-intentioned system that works for sixteen-year-olds may harm eight-year-olds.

### Parental Override Complexity

Parental controls assume parents are informed, engaged, and aligned with children's interests. In practice, parents vary in technical literacy, attention, and wisdom.

### Commercial Interests

Companies face commercial incentives to maximize child engagement. Voluntary commitments to child safety are often weak against these incentives.

## Governance Approaches

Better governance for children and AI might include:

### Developmental Tiering

Rather than one category of "child," governance could tier by developmental stage: early childhood, middle childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence. Requirements would differ by tier.

This adds complexity but reflects reality.

### Design Standards

Systems intended for children could be required to meet design standards: not just content restrictions but design features that support healthy use. Stopping mechanisms, time limits, and low-stimulus defaults could be mandated rather than optional.

### Data Minimization

Collecting data on children for training AI systems or targeting advertising could face heightened restrictions. Children's data is particularly sensitive because it accumulates over their lifetimes.

### Parental Tools

Parents could be provided better tools for understanding and managing their children's AI exposure. Not just on/off controls but meaningful insight into what children are experiencing.

### Independent Oversight

Systems affecting children could face independent oversight: not just company assertions of safety but external evaluation of actual effects on child development and welfare.

### Child Input

Older children could participate in governance of systems that affect them. This is challenging but acknowledges children's own stake in how they are governed.

## Tensions and Tradeoffs

Governance for children involves tensions.

### Protection vs. Autonomy

Protecting children from harm can restrict their autonomy and growth. Some risks are developmentally appropriate. Overprotection may harm development just as underprotection does.

### Parental Authority vs. State Authority vs. Child Interest

Parents, governments, and children themselves may have different views on appropriate AI exposure. Whose authority prevails? Different political and cultural traditions answer this differently.

### Access vs. Safety

Restricting children's access to AI systems may deprive them of benefits. Educational tools, creative aids, and information access have value. Safety measures that restrict access impose opportunity costs.

### Enforcement Feasibility

Age verification is technically difficult. Developmental assessment is even harder. Governance that cannot be enforced may be worse than no governance if it creates false security.

## Conclusion

Children are a distinct population requiring distinct governance considerations. Current AI governance largely fails to account for this distinction.

The inadequacy is not primarily malicious. It reflects adult-centric default thinking and the genuine difficulty of addressing developmental variation.

But the stakes are high. AI systems shaping childhood experiences may shape adult citizens, workers, and individuals in lasting ways. Getting this right matters.

Governance that takes children seriously would: tier by developmental stage, impose design standards beyond content restriction, minimize data collection, provide parents with meaningful tools, and include independent oversight.

None of this is easy. All of it is important.
