## The Democratic Deficit

AI governance is largely shaped by technical experts, industry representatives, and government officials. Ordinary citizens—the people who will be most affected by AI—have limited voice.

This democratic deficit matters. AI raises fundamental questions about values, rights, and the kind of society we want to live in. These are not merely technical questions to be answered by experts. They require democratic input.

This analysis examines mechanisms for meaningful public participation in AI governance—what works, what doesn't, and how participation could be strengthened.

## Why Public Participation Matters

Several arguments support greater public participation in AI policy.

### Democratic Legitimacy

In democratic societies, policies that significantly affect citizens should reflect their input. AI governance that excludes public participation lacks democratic legitimacy, even if it produces sensible outcomes.

### Value Judgments

AI governance involves value judgments—about acceptable risk, privacy versus convenience, fairness definitions, and acceptable uses. These are not technical questions with objectively correct answers. Democratic processes are how societies make collective value judgments.

### Affected Interests

Those affected by decisions have a stake in those decisions. AI affects everyone—workers whose jobs change, consumers whose choices are shaped, citizens whose public services are automated. Affected interests should be represented in governance.

### Error Correction

Expert-dominated governance can develop blind spots. Public participation brings diverse perspectives that can identify problems experts miss. Technocratic governance that excludes public input may entrench elite assumptions.

### Trust Building

Public participation can build trust in AI governance. Policies developed with public input are more likely to be accepted as legitimate, even by those who disagree with specific decisions.

## Current Mechanisms

Various mechanisms currently exist for public participation in AI policy.

### Public Comment Periods

Regulatory processes often include public comment periods. When the EU developed the AI Act, or when agencies develop rules, the public can submit comments.

**Limitations:** Comments are often technical, favoring well-resourced organizations over individual citizens. Comment volume doesn't equal influence. Agencies may satisfy procedural requirements without meaningfully engaging with public input.

### Public Consultations

Governments conduct consultations on AI policy—publishing documents, soliciting feedback, and sometimes holding events.

**Limitations:** Participation requires awareness, time, and often expertise. Consultations may be pro forma exercises with predetermined conclusions.

### Advisory Bodies

Some governments include public representatives on AI advisory bodies or ethics councils.

**Limitations:** Representatives may not be representative. Advisory bodies often lack power. Composition may favor industry or academia over broader public.

### Elections

Ultimately, voters choose representatives who make policy, including AI policy.

**Limitations:** AI rarely determines elections. Representatives may lack AI knowledge. Legislative processes are slow relative to technological change.

### Litigation

Citizens can challenge AI governance through litigation—suing over algorithmic decisions, challenging regulations, enforcing rights.

**Limitations:** Litigation is expensive and slow. Individual cases rarely address systemic issues. Not all harms are legally cognizable.

## More Innovative Approaches

Several innovative approaches attempt deeper public engagement.

### Citizens' Assemblies

Randomly selected citizens deliberate on policy questions, informed by expert testimony, and develop recommendations.

**Examples:** Several jurisdictions have used citizens' assemblies for AI—Taiwan's Digital Minister has used citizen deliberation, and various countries have piloted AI-focused assemblies.

**Advantages:** Randomly selected participants are more representative than self-selected commenters. Deliberation enables informed judgment, not just reaction. Results carry legitimacy.

**Limitations:** Assemblies are expensive to organize well. Recommendations may be ignored. Topics must be framed accessibly.

### Participatory Technology Assessment

Processes for public assessment of emerging technology, combining expert information with citizen deliberation.

**Examples:** The Danish Board of Technology pioneered these approaches; various countries have adapted them.

**Advantages:** Structured combination of expertise and public judgment. Focus on technology policy specifically.

**Limitations:** Requires significant investment. Not widely used in AI context yet.

### Community Juries

Small groups of citizens hear evidence and deliberate on specific policy questions, similar to legal juries.

**Advantages:** Intensive deliberation. Manageable scale. Focus on specific questions.

**Limitations:** Small scale limits representativeness. Not decision-making, only advisory.

### Digital Participation Platforms

Online platforms enabling broader participation in policy development—commenting, voting, proposing amendments.

**Examples:** Taiwan's vTaiwan platform has been used for technology policy, including AI-related topics.

**Advantages:** Scale beyond in-person processes. Lower barriers to participation.

**Limitations:** Digital divide excludes some populations. Quality of engagement may be lower than in-person deliberation. Vulnerable to manipulation.

### Participatory Budgeting

Citizens directly allocate public funds to projects, potentially including AI governance investments.

**Advantages:** Tangible decision-making power, not just advice.

**Limitations:** Rarely applied to AI specifically. Budget allocation is only one governance lever.

## Design Principles

Effective public participation requires careful design.

### Accessibility

Participation must be accessible to diverse citizens, not just the already-engaged. This requires:

- Plain language, not jargon
- Multiple participation channels
- Accessibility for disabled participants
- Support for those with fewer resources

### Information Quality

Participants need accurate, balanced information to make informed judgments. This requires:

- Trusted information sources
- Presentation of multiple perspectives
- Technical translation without distortion
- Time for learning

### Deliberation Quality

Participation should enable genuine deliberation, not just aggregation of unconsidered preferences:

- Structured discussion processes
- Facilitation that ensures balanced participation
- Time for reflection and revision
- Exposure to diverse views

### Influence

Participation must have genuine influence on outcomes:

- Clear connection between participation and decisions
- Transparency about how input was used
- Accountability for ignoring input
- Some decisions within direct participant control

### Representativeness

Participants should represent the broader public:

- Random selection rather than self-selection where possible
- Attention to demographic diversity
- Reach to typically excluded communities
- Recognition of differential expertise and stakes

### Iteration

Single consultations are insufficient for ongoing governance:

- Regular participation opportunities
- Learning and adaptation over time
- Ongoing accountability mechanisms
- Participation in implementation, not just design

## What Decisions Suit Public Participation

Not all AI governance decisions equally suit public participation.

### Well-Suited

- Fundamental value choices (privacy versus convenience, acceptable risk levels)
- Use case approvals (should facial recognition be used in public spaces?)
- Benefit distribution (who should gain from AI automation?)
- Rights protections (what should be non-negotiable?)

These involve value judgments that should be made democratically.

### Less Suited

- Technical specifications (model architecture choices)
- Implementation details (regulatory procedures)
- Rapid operational decisions (incident response)

These require expertise or speed that public participation can't provide.

### Mixed

- Risk assessment (combines technical and value elements)
- Regulatory frameworks (technical detail but fundamental choices)
- Standards development (technical but with governance implications)

These benefit from public input on value dimensions while respecting technical constraints.

## The Reflexive Connection

Our work on reflexive governance has implications for public participation.

**Transparency as enabler.** AI systems that [explain their constraints](/research/026-explaining-constraints/) and [communicate uncertainty](/research/027-uncertainty-communication/) make AI more legible to non-experts, potentially enabling more informed public participation.

**AI-mediated participation.** AI might help scale participation—summarizing comments, identifying consensus, translating technical content. But AI mediation also risks bias and manipulation.

**Participation in reflexive governance.** As AI systems increasingly participate in their own governance, democratic input into how this works becomes essential. The public should shape the terms of AI's reflexive participation, not just accept whatever developers create.

## Recommendations

To strengthen public participation in AI governance:

**Institutionalize participation.** Create standing mechanisms for public input, not just occasional consultations. Build participation into regular governance processes.

**Invest in deliberation.** Fund properly designed deliberative processes—citizens' assemblies, participatory technology assessment—not just comment periods.

**Build capacity.** Invest in public understanding of AI through education, journalism, and accessible materials.

**Ensure influence.** Connect participation to actual decisions. Create accountability for ignoring public input.

**Reach excluded communities.** Actively engage those typically excluded from policy processes—marginalized communities, workers affected by AI, rural populations.

**Iterate and learn.** Treat participation as ongoing practice, not one-time event. Learn from what works and improve.

## Conclusion

Meaningful public participation in AI governance is both normatively required and practically valuable. Current mechanisms are insufficient—dominated by experts and industry, with limited authentic public voice.

Better approaches exist and should be more widely implemented. Citizens' assemblies, participatory assessment, and structured deliberation can enable informed public judgment on AI governance.

This is not about replacing expertise with popular opinion. It's about ensuring that expert input serves democratically determined goals—that AI governance reflects not just what's technically possible but what society actually wants.
