## Introduction

Public attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) are a critical input into both governance and policy design. Policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders increasingly cite public trust as a central consideration in AI deployment. However, understanding public opinion on AI is fraught with methodological challenges. What people think about AI is not static: it evolves with exposure, media framing, and lived experience. 

Survey methods—tools for systematically gathering data on public attitudes—offer a structured way to measure and analyze these perceptions. Yet, the design of such surveys is far from straightforward. Question wording, sampling techniques, cultural contexts, and response biases can all shape results. This article outlines key methodologies for surveying public attitudes toward AI, evaluates their strengths and weaknesses, and discusses their implications for policymaking.

## Why Survey Public Attitudes on AI?

The rationale for surveying public opinion on AI extends beyond academic curiosity. Public sentiment shapes the political feasibility of regulatory interventions, influences adoption rates, and can even affect AI-related trust crises. For example, public concerns about AI surveillance have already led to legislative action in some jurisdictions, such as bans on facial recognition in certain cities. Surveys help stakeholders understand where the public stands on key issues, such as:

- **Trust:** How much do people trust AI systems in critical domains like healthcare or law enforcement?
- **Perceived Risks:** What risks do individuals associate with AI, such as job displacement, privacy erosion, or bias?
- **Desirable Outcomes:** What benefits do people expect or hope to see from AI advancements?
- **Policy Preferences:** What types of regulation does the public support, such as transparency requirements or liability frameworks?

By quantifying these dimensions, surveys offer a foundation for evidence-based policymaking. However, these tools are only as good as their design.

## Survey Design: Key Considerations

Survey design plays a pivotal role in determining the quality and reliability of the data collected. Below, we explore critical aspects of survey design that are particularly relevant for measuring public attitudes toward AI.

### Question Wording and Framing

The way a survey question is worded can significantly influence responses. For example, asking, "Do you trust AI?" is far less informative than asking, "How much do you trust AI to make fair decisions in hiring processes?" The former is ambiguous, while the latter provides context and specificity.

Framing effects are also important. Research shows that emphasizing either the benefits or risks of AI can bias responses. For instance, participants who are first told about AI's potential to improve medical diagnostics may report higher trust levels than those who are first told about cases of AI-enabled discrimination. To mitigate this, surveys should strive for neutrality in question framing and consider using randomized question orders to reduce order effects.

### Sampling Strategies

A survey's representativeness hinges on its sampling strategy. Non-representative samples can lead to skewed results, making it difficult to generalize findings to the broader population. Common sampling methods include:

- **Probability Sampling:** This approach ensures that every individual in the target population has an equal chance of being selected. While robust, it can be expensive and time-consuming.
- **Convenience Sampling:** Frequently used in online surveys, this method is more cost-effective but risks over-representing certain demographics, such as younger, tech-savvy individuals.
- **Stratified Sampling:** This technique divides the population into subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, or education level) and samples proportionally, ensuring diverse representation.

Given the digital nature of AI, online survey platforms are often the default choice. However, this introduces challenges in reaching populations without reliable internet access, such as older adults or residents of low-income areas. These gaps can skew survey results unless addressed through targeted outreach or weighting adjustments.

### Cultural and Regional Contexts

AI is not a uniform concept across cultures. In some regions, AI may be closely associated with automation and job loss; in others, it may be viewed more optimistically as a tool for economic development. Surveys must account for these cultural nuances by adapting questions to local contexts. For example, a survey conducted in rural India might focus on AI in agriculture, whereas a survey in a U.S. urban center might focus on autonomous vehicles.

Translation and localization are also critical. Poorly translated surveys can confuse respondents and undermine data quality. It is essential to collaborate with local experts to ensure that survey instruments are culturally and linguistically appropriate.

### Addressing Response Biases

Response biases, such as social desirability bias, can distort survey results. For instance, respondents may overstate their trust in AI if they believe that is the "correct" answer. Similarly, acquiescence bias can lead participants to agree with statements regardless of their actual opinions.

Several strategies can mitigate these biases:

- **Anonymity:** Ensuring respondent anonymity can reduce social desirability bias.
- **Balanced Scales:** Providing a range of response options, including neutral or "don't know" choices, can help capture genuine opinions.
- **Validation Questions:** Including questions designed to check for inconsistent or inattentive responses can improve data quality.

## Methods for Measuring AI-Specific Attitudes

Given the complexities of AI as a topic, traditional survey methods often require adaptation. Below, we review some innovative approaches for measuring AI-specific attitudes.

### Scenario-Based Surveys

Scenario-based surveys present respondents with hypothetical situations involving AI and ask for their reactions. For example, a survey might describe an AI system making parole decisions and ask respondents whether they believe the system is fair. This approach allows researchers to explore attitudes toward specific applications of AI rather than AI in general.

However, scenario-based surveys have limitations. Respondents may lack the context or expertise to fully understand the scenarios, leading to superficial or inconsistent responses. To address this, scenarios should be accompanied by clear explanations and, where possible, visual aids.

### Longitudinal Surveys

Public attitudes toward AI are likely to evolve over time, especially as AI systems become more integrated into daily life. Longitudinal surveys, which track the same respondents over multiple time points, can provide valuable insights into these dynamics. For example, a longitudinal study might reveal how exposure to AI-powered healthcare services affects trust over time.

While longitudinal surveys offer rich data, they are resource-intensive and face challenges such as respondent attrition. Nevertheless, they are invaluable for understanding the long-term trajectories of public opinion.

### Cross-National Surveys

AI governance is a global challenge, but public attitudes can vary significantly between countries. Cross-national surveys, such as those conducted by organizations like Pew Research, provide comparative insights into these differences. For instance, a cross-national survey might find that trust in AI is higher in countries with strong data protection laws, highlighting the role of governance in shaping public sentiment.

Designing cross-national surveys requires careful attention to cultural and linguistic differences, as discussed earlier. Additionally, researchers must consider how varying levels of AI adoption and awareness might influence responses.

## Implications for Policy and Governance

Survey data on public attitudes can inform a wide range of policy decisions. For example:

- **Regulatory Priorities:** If surveys reveal widespread public concern about AI bias, regulators may prioritize policies that address algorithmic fairness.
- **Public Engagement:** Understanding public attitudes can help policymakers design more effective outreach and education campaigns, fostering informed discussions about AI.
- **International Cooperation:** Cross-national surveys can highlight areas of common concern, facilitating international collaboration on AI governance.

Moreover, survey findings can serve as a counterbalance to industry narratives, ensuring that the voices of diverse stakeholders are represented in policymaking. For example, as discussed in [The Principal-Agent Problem, Literally](/research/115-the-principal-agent-problem-literally), industry actors may have incentives to downplay certain risks, making independent public opinion data even more critical.

## Conclusion

Surveying public attitudes toward AI is both a methodological and ethical challenge. While the insights gained can be invaluable for policy and governance, the quality of those insights depends on rigorous survey design and execution. Researchers must navigate pitfalls such as biased question framing, non-representative sampling, and cultural insensitivity. By adopting best practices and leveraging innovative methods like scenario-based and longitudinal surveys, we can build a more nuanced understanding of public sentiment.

As AI continues to reshape society, monitoring public attitudes will be essential. These insights will not only inform better governance but also help bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal trust.
