## The Missing Perspective

Open any AI governance paper. The framings are familiar: the EU AI Act, US executive orders, Chinese regulations, the US-China race, competition between OpenAI and Anthropic.

What about Nigeria? Indonesia? Brazil? Argentina? Kenya? Vietnam?

These countries are not peripheral to AI. They are significant markets, talent sources, and use contexts. Yet their perspectives are largely absent from governance discourse. When global governance is discussed, it usually means: how should rich countries coordinate?

This absence matters. AI governance designed by and for wealthy countries may not serve, and may actively harm, everyone else.

## Different Starting Points

Global South countries approach AI from different starting positions than wealthy nations.

### Infrastructure Gaps

Reliable electricity, internet connectivity, and computing infrastructure are not universal. AI systems that assume stable connectivity may fail where infrastructure is spotty.

Cloud computing can partially address hardware gaps, but it creates dependencies on foreign providers. Data must flow to data centers elsewhere, raising sovereignty concerns.

### Data Asymmetries

AI systems trained on Western data may not work well elsewhere. Languages, names, faces, and contexts differ. A model trained on English struggles with Yoruba. A face recognition system trained on light skin fails on dark skin.

The data needed to train localized models exists in Global South populations but is often extracted by foreign companies rather than used locally.

### Economic Positioning

Wealthy countries produce AI. Many Global South countries primarily consume it. This creates asymmetric relationships: terms of use are set by producers, disputes are resolved in producer jurisdictions, profits flow to producer countries.

AI may extend extractive economic patterns where raw resources (now data and labor) are extracted and processed elsewhere.

### Regulatory Capacity

Effective AI governance requires regulatory capacity: technical expertise, legal frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, and resources. Many Global South countries lack this capacity, not due to any inherent limitation but because building regulatory capacity takes time and resources.

Regulations designed for high-capacity contexts may not be implementable elsewhere.

## Different Risks

The risks that dominate wealthy-country discourse may not be the most pressing elsewhere.

### Immediate Harms vs. Speculative Risks

In wealthy countries, debates about existential risk and superintelligence receive significant attention. These debates assume a context where basic needs are met and speculation about far futures is affordable.

In countries where poverty, disease, and conflict are immediate concerns, speculative risks may seem luxuries. The harm from a biased loan algorithm denying credit to millions is concrete and present.

This is not to say long-term risks are unimportant. It is to say that priorities legitimately differ.

### Digital Colonialism

A risk distinctly salient in the Global South: AI as a mechanism for extending foreign power. When AI systems are designed abroad, hosted abroad, and controlled abroad, they may advance foreign interests over local ones.

Surveillance AI sold to governments may enable oppression. Agricultural AI may extract data about farming practices that's monetized elsewhere. Language models may homogenize toward dominant languages and cultures.

Governance focused on managing AI development may miss governance needs for managing AI consumption.

### Labor Displacement

The labor impacts of AI differ by economic structure. Wealthy countries worry about knowledge worker displacement. Many Global South countries have large agricultural and informal sectors where AI impacts differ.

But Global South countries also provide much of the low-wage labor that trains AI systems: content moderation in Kenya, data labeling in Venezuela, customer service in the Philippines. The politics of this labor are largely invisible in governance discussions.

### Beneficial Applications

AI also has distinctive beneficial applications in Global South contexts. Agricultural advice for smallholder farmers. Healthcare diagnostics where physicians are scarce. Financial services for unbanked populations. Translation among hundreds of local languages.

Governance that focuses exclusively on risk may neglect enabling benefits that matter most where resources are scarcest.

## Different Governance Needs

Given different contexts and risks, Global South countries may need different governance approaches.

### Sovereignty and Data Governance

Who controls data matters. Governance that enables local control over local data, requires data localization or at least access, and prevents pure extraction may be priorities.

This may conflict with wealthy-country interests in free data flows and foreign-company access.

### Capacity Building

Before effective governance, regulatory capacity is needed. International support for building this capacity, not just exporting regulations designed elsewhere, may be more valuable than specific rules.

This includes technical training, institutional development, and resources for ongoing engagement with evolving technology.

### Technology Transfer

Access to AI technology itself matters. Open-source models enable local development and customization. Restrictive regimes that lock capabilities in a few wealthy-country companies may perpetuate dependence.

Governance that promotes openness may serve Global South interests even if it complicates control.

### Representation in Global Processes

When AI governance is coordinated internationally, through the UN, OECD, or industry bodies, Global South representation matters. Token inclusion is insufficient. Meaningful participation requires resources, capacity, and weight in decision-making.

Current structures often under-represent the majority of the world's population.

## Tensions and Trade-offs

Global North and Global South interests are not always aligned.

**Safety vs. access.** Stringent safety requirements may limit what AI systems are available or affordable in lower-resource contexts. A country that needs diagnostic AI may accept higher error rates than a wealthy country would.

**Openness vs. control.** Open-source models enable adaptation but also enable misuse. The optimal tradeoff may differ by context.

**Speed vs. caution.** Countries seeking rapid development may prioritize speed over caution. Countries already developed may prioritize caution over speed.

**Sovereignty vs. integration.** Local control over AI may conflict with beneficial integration into global systems.

These tensions do not have universal right answers. Different contexts produce different optimal balances.

## What This Means for Global Governance

Global AI governance that ignores Global South perspectives will fail.

**Legitimacy.** Governance imposed by wealthy countries on everyone else lacks legitimacy. Without buy-in, compliance is unlikely and resentment is certain.

**Effectiveness.** Governance designed for wealthy-country contexts may not work elsewhere. Rules that assume high regulatory capacity, stable infrastructure, and producer-side leverage may be irrelevant.

**Representation.** Designing governance that works globally requires global input. Not after the fact, not as consultation, but in governance design itself.

**Differentiation.** One-size-fits-all governance may not fit anyone well. Acknowledging that different countries may need different approaches, tiered regimes rather than uniform rules, may be more practical.

## Conclusion

AI governance is currently a conversation among wealthy countries about their concerns. This is understandable: wealthy countries currently dominate AI development.

But AI is global. Its benefits and harms reach everywhere. Governance that ignores the majority of the world is incomplete at best and illegitimate at worst.

Incorporating Global South perspectives is not charity. It is essential for governance that works. Different contexts surface different problems, test different assumptions, and generate different solutions.

The reflexive governance framework should apply this reflexively: examining whose perspectives shape the framework itself and whose are excluded.
