## Introduction

As artificial intelligence (AI) systems grow in capability and influence, the ethical challenges surrounding data governance have become more pronounced. Among these challenges is the question of **Indigenous data sovereignty**: the right of Indigenous peoples to govern the collection, ownership, and use of data that pertains to their communities, lands, and cultures. Historically, data about Indigenous communities has been collected, used, and shared without meaningful consultation or consent, perpetuating patterns of exploitation and marginalization under the guise of research or development. The emergence of AI technologies, which rely heavily on vast datasets for training and operation, raises new questions about how Indigenous data sovereignty can and should be respected in this context.

This article explores the intersection of Indigenous data sovereignty and AI, considering its implications for governance, policy, and ethical AI development. Specifically, it examines how Indigenous principles of self-determination and autonomy over data can contribute to more equitable AI systems. It also highlights the risks of perpetuating "data colonialism"—a term used to describe the systemic extraction of data from marginalized communities for the benefit of external entities—and proposes pathways toward a more inclusive, participatory approach to AI governance.

## Defining Indigenous Data Sovereignty

Indigenous data sovereignty is rooted in the broader concept of **Indigenous sovereignty**, which encompasses the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples to govern themselves, their lands, and their resources. Applied to data, it refers to the right of Indigenous peoples to exercise control over the collection, ownership, and application of data that relates to their communities. This includes information about their cultures, traditions, languages, lands, and individuals.

Several frameworks have been established to promote and operationalize Indigenous data sovereignty. The **CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance**—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—offer a clear counterpoint to the widely recognized FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Unlike FAIR, which emphasizes making data accessible for broader scientific use, CARE prioritizes the rights and interests of Indigenous communities, emphasizing that data governance must be ethical, culturally relevant, and aligned with Indigenous values.

However, these principles are often in tension with the practices of large-scale data collection and analysis that underpin many AI systems. For example, training large language models often involves the indiscriminate scraping of online content, some of which includes Indigenous languages, stories, and cultural knowledge. These practices raise critical questions about consent, ownership, and the ethical use of data in AI.

## The Risks of Data Colonialism in AI Development

The term **data colonialism** refers to the systemic extraction of data from marginalized communities—often without their knowledge or consent—for the benefit of powerful entities such as corporations or governments. In the context of AI, this manifests in several ways:

1. **Unconsented Use of Cultural Knowledge:** AI models trained on large datasets frequently incorporate Indigenous languages, stories, and other culturally significant materials. For instance, Indigenous narratives or linguistic patterns may be embedded in natural language processing models, often without explicit permission or acknowledgment. This not only violates Indigenous data sovereignty but also risks commodifying sacred knowledge or misrepresenting cultural meanings.

2. **Reinforcement of Inequities:** AI systems are prone to replicating and amplifying existing biases in the data they are trained on. For Indigenous communities, this can mean the perpetuation of stereotypes or the erasure of their unique cultural contexts. For example, predictive policing algorithms trained on biased crime data may disproportionately target Indigenous individuals, exacerbating existing inequalities in law enforcement.

3. **Exclusion from Benefits:** While AI technologies promise transformative benefits, they often fail to address the specific needs of Indigenous communities. Worse, these technologies may extract value from Indigenous data without providing any reciprocal benefits to the communities from which the data originated. This dynamic mirrors historical patterns of exploitation, where resources were extracted from Indigenous lands without fair compensation.

These risks underscore the need for AI governance frameworks that explicitly address Indigenous data sovereignty. Without such measures, the development and deployment of AI risk reinforcing systemic injustices that Indigenous communities have long sought to overcome.

## Principles for Aligning AI with Indigenous Data Sovereignty

Addressing the challenges outlined above requires a fundamental rethinking of how data is governed in the development and deployment of AI systems. Drawing from the CARE Principles and related frameworks, the following principles offer a foundation for aligning AI governance with Indigenous data sovereignty:

### 1. **Prior and Informed Consent**
The principle of prior and informed consent is central to Indigenous data sovereignty. It requires that Indigenous communities have the opportunity to provide or withhold consent before any data collection or use occurs. In the context of AI, this means that data collection processes must be transparent, participatory, and respectful of Indigenous decision-making processes. This principle is particularly relevant in addressing practices like data scraping, which often bypass consent entirely.

### 2. **Equitable Data Sharing**
Data sharing agreements should prioritize the collective benefit of Indigenous communities. This includes ensuring that the benefits derived from AI systems trained on Indigenous data—whether financial, social, or technological—are shared equitably. Such agreements could take the form of data trusts or cooperatives, where Indigenous communities retain control over how their data is used and benefit directly from its application.

### 3. **Cultural Sensitivity and Ethical Use**
AI developers must recognize that not all data is neutral. In many Indigenous cultures, certain types of knowledge are considered sacred or are governed by specific protocols for sharing. These cultural considerations should be integrated into AI development processes, with mechanisms for ensuring that sensitive data is not misused or misrepresented.

### 4. **Capacity Building and Co-Design**
To meaningfully participate in AI governance, Indigenous communities must have the resources and capabilities to engage in the design, development, and oversight of AI systems. This includes support for education and training in AI technologies, as well as opportunities for collaboration with researchers and developers. Co-design processes, where Indigenous voices are involved from the outset, can help ensure that AI systems align with community values and priorities.

## Policy Implications for AI Governance

Incorporating Indigenous data sovereignty into AI governance requires not only voluntary commitments from developers but also robust policy frameworks that enforce these principles. Governments and international bodies have a critical role to play in establishing standards and regulations that prioritize Indigenous rights. Key policy considerations include:

- **Legal Recognition of Indigenous Data Sovereignty:** Governments should formally recognize the right of Indigenous communities to govern their data, drawing on models such as New Zealand's Treaty of Waitangi or Canada's commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).
- **Mandating Transparency in AI Development:** Policymakers can require that AI developers disclose the sources of their training data and demonstrate that they have obtained informed consent for any data derived from Indigenous communities. This echoes the broader call for proportional disclosure discussed in [Digital Sovereignty and AI Infrastructure](/research/110-digital-sovereignty-and-ai-infrastructure).
- **Supporting Indigenous Data Governance Initiatives:** Governments and international organizations can provide funding and technical support for initiatives that enable Indigenous communities to manage their data, such as the development of data repositories or the establishment of data stewardship roles.

## Toward Reflexive AI Systems

The integration of Indigenous data sovereignty principles into AI governance is not merely a matter of ethics; it is also a question of building more robust and inclusive AI systems. By incorporating diverse perspectives and respecting the rights of all communities, developers can create systems that are not only more equitable but also more effective in addressing complex global challenges.

Reflexivity, or the ability to continuously adapt and respond to new information and perspectives, is a critical characteristic of ethical AI governance. As discussed in [Agentic AI: A Governance Framework](/research/111-agentic-ai-a-governance-framework), reflexive systems are better equipped to navigate the uncertainties and complexities of real-world deployment. By embedding principles of Indigenous data sovereignty into their design, AI systems can better reflect the values and needs of diverse stakeholders.

## Conclusion

The intersection of Indigenous data sovereignty and AI highlights both the risks and opportunities associated with the rapid expansion of data-driven technologies. On the one hand, current practices risk perpetuating patterns of data colonialism, undermining the rights and interests of Indigenous communities. On the other hand, aligning AI development with principles of Indigenous data sovereignty offers a pathway toward more ethical, equitable, and inclusive systems.

To achieve this, we must move beyond tokenistic engagement with Indigenous communities and toward genuine partnerships that prioritize their autonomy and expertise. This requires not only a shift in the practices of AI developers but also the establishment of robust policy frameworks that enforce the principles of prior consent, equitable benefit-sharing, and cultural sensitivity.

By embedding Indigenous data sovereignty into AI governance, we can take an important step toward a more just and inclusive digital future.
