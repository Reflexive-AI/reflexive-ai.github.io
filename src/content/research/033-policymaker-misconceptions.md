## The Problem with AI Risk Discourse

Policymakers face an unenviable task. They must govern a technology they didn't create, often don't fully understand, and that changes faster than legislative processes can accommodate. Under these conditions, misconceptions are inevitable.

But misconceptions lead to ineffective policy. Resources are directed at the wrong problems. Real risks go unaddressed while imaginary ones consume attention. This analysis identifies the most common and consequential errors in how policymakers think about AI risk—and suggests corrections.

This builds on our examination of [why AI regulation is difficult](/research/regulation-is-hard/) and offers concrete guidance for more effective policy thinking.

## Misconception 1: AI Risk Is Primarily About Job Loss

**The error.** Many policymakers frame AI primarily as an economic disruption issue. Hearings focus on employment impacts. Policies emphasize retraining programs and social safety nets.

**Why it's wrong.** While economic disruption is real and deserves attention, framing AI risk primarily through this lens misses the more urgent governance challenges:

- AI systems making consequential decisions about people's lives
- Potential for AI to enable harmful actions at scale
- Erosion of epistemic infrastructure through AI-generated content
- Concentration of power in organizations controlling AI capabilities

Job displacement is a policy problem, but it's a familiar one with established response tools. The novel challenges of AI require novel responses.

**Better framing.** AI presents multiple risk categories requiring different policy responses. Economic disruption is one. Safety risks, rights implications, and power concentration are others. Policy should address all of them, not just the most politically familiar.

## Misconception 2: We Need AI Experts to Tell Us What to Do

**The error.** Policymakers often defer entirely to technical experts, treating AI governance as primarily a technical question to be answered by those who build the technology.

**Why it's wrong.** Technical expertise is necessary but insufficient for governance. The core questions are not technical:

- How much risk is acceptable in exchange for what benefits?
- Who should bear the costs of AI development?
- What uses of AI are compatible with human rights and dignity?
- How should power over AI be distributed?

These are political, ethical, and social questions. Technical experts can inform them but cannot answer them. As we explored in [the honest AI problem](/research/honest-ai/), even questions that seem technical often embed deep value judgments.

**Better approach.** Use technical expertise to understand capabilities and constraints. Use democratic processes to make value judgments. Don't confuse the two.

## Misconception 3: The Choice Is Innovation or Safety

**The error.** AI governance debates often assume a tradeoff between innovation (minimal regulation, faster development) and safety (more regulation, slower development). Policymakers feel forced to choose between economic competitiveness and protection.

**Why it's wrong.** This framing is often wrong and always incomplete.

First, some safety measures have minimal impact on innovation speed. Transparency requirements, incident reporting, and certain testing protocols impose modest costs while significantly improving oversight.

Second, unsafe AI creates its own drag on innovation. If AI systems cause significant harms, the backlash will be worse than prudent regulation. Industries often prefer predictable regulation to uncertain liability exposure.

Third, the tradeoff framing ignores distribution. Innovation benefits may accrue to some actors while safety costs fall on others. Policy should address this distribution, not just the aggregate.

**Better framing.** Ask: What specific safety measures are proposed? What are their actual costs and benefits? Who bears each? This granular analysis is more productive than abstract innovation-vs-safety debates.

## Misconception 4: AI Is Either Overhyped or Existential Threat

**The error.** AI risk discussions tend toward extremes. Either AI is "just statistics" that doesn't warrant special attention, or it's an existential threat demanding emergency action. Policymakers often pick one extreme based on political priors.

**Why it's wrong.** Both framings impede effective policy.

The dismissive view leads to underinvestment in governance capacity. By the time risks materialize, institutional capacity to respond is lacking. This happened with social media governance—the time to build oversight capacity is before problems become crises.

The emergency view leads to rushed, poorly designed interventions. It can also provoke backlash that makes governance harder. And by focusing on speculative long-term risks, it may distract from concrete near-term harms.

**Better approach.** Take AI seriously as a governance challenge without requiring certainty about extreme scenarios. Build institutions that can respond flexibly. Address concrete harms now while maintaining awareness of potential future challenges. This is the approach we advocate throughout our research on [proportionality](/research/proportionality-disclosure/) and [capability assessment](/research/capability-evaluations/).

## Misconception 5: Voluntary Commitments Are Sufficient

**The error.** Faced with legislative complexity and lobbying pressure, policymakers often accept voluntary commitments from AI companies as adequate governance.

**Why it's wrong.** Voluntary commitments suffer systematic weaknesses:

- No enforcement mechanism when commitments conflict with profit
- Selective participation—companies with worse practices don't volunteer
- Moving targets—commitments can be quietly weakened
- Opacity—compliance is self-assessed

We analyzed these dynamics in detail in [self-reporting versus external audit](/research/self-reporting-vs-audit/). History suggests that voluntary commitments work when backed by credible threat of regulation, not as alternatives to it.

**Better approach.** Voluntary commitments can be useful for exploring governance approaches and building consensus. But they should precede, not replace, enforceable requirements.

## Misconception 6: China's Approach Makes Governance Impossible

**The error.** Policymakers often argue that AI governance is impossible because China (or other competitors) won't follow rules, so any constraints merely disadvantage domestic industry.

**Why it's wrong.** This reasoning fails on multiple levels:

- Not all governance is about race dynamics. Domestic AI safety—preventing harms to your own citizens—matters regardless of what other countries do.
- Competition arguments assume governance primarily constrains. But governance can also build trust that expands AI adoption.
- The argument proves too much. If international competition made governance impossible, we couldn't regulate anything.
- China has, in fact, implemented significant AI regulations—in some areas more restrictive than Western approaches.

**Better framing.** Some governance measures make sense unilaterally; others require international coordination. Distinguish between them. Don't use international competition as an excuse to avoid governance where it isn't relevant.

## Misconception 7: We Should Wait Until Harms Are Proven

**The error.** Some policymakers argue that AI governance should wait until concrete harms are demonstrated—a "permissionless innovation" approach.

**Why it's wrong.** This approach works poorly for AI for several reasons:

- AI harms may be difficult to prove. Algorithmic discrimination might never be noticed without auditing requirements.
- Some harms are irreversible or catastrophic. A "wait and see" approach is appropriate for recoverable harms, not for potential catastrophes.
- By the time harms are proven, industry structure may make intervention difficult. Regulatory capture is easier when industries are established.

The [capability overhang problem](/research/capability-overhang/) means that risks may exist but remain undiscovered. Waiting for demonstrated harm may mean waiting until it's too late.

**Better approach.** Use risk-based assessment. Where potential harms are serious and irreversible, precaution is justified. Where harms are minor and reversible, lighter-touch approaches make sense. The EU AI Act's tiered approach, whatever its flaws, gets this basic structure right.

## Misconception 8: Technical Standards Will Solve Everything

**The error.** Policymakers sometimes expect that technical standards—for safety testing, model cards, impact assessments—can substitute for institutional oversight.

**Why it's wrong.** Technical standards are tools, not solutions. They need:

- Governance of the standard-setting process itself (who decides?)
- Enforcement mechanisms (what happens when standards are violated?)
- Adaptation processes (how are standards updated?)
- Interpretation authority (who resolves ambiguity?)

Standards without institutions are like traffic laws without traffic police. They describe expected behavior but cannot ensure it. This is why we focus on [meta-governance](/research/meta-governance-auditors/)—governing the governance mechanisms themselves.

**Better approach.** Technical standards should be embedded in institutional frameworks that ensure their development is legitimate, their application is consistent, and their enforcement is real.

## Toward Better Policy Thinking

Good AI policy requires:

**Proportionality.** Match governance intensity to actual risk, not to hype or fear. See our [proportionality framework](/research/proportionality-disclosure/).

**Institutional capacity.** Build the expertise and authority to govern AI before crises force rushed responses.

**Stakeholder inclusion.** Technical experts inform, but democratic processes decide. This is central to our vision of [reflexive governance](/research/manifesto/).

**Adaptive design.** Create governance mechanisms that can evolve as technology and understanding change.

**Evidence orientation.** Demand evidence for claims about costs and benefits, from both industry advocates and safety advocates.

The stakes are high enough to warrant serious policy attention—and high enough to warrant getting policy right.
