## Introduction

Agriculture remains the backbone of many low-income countries, where it accounts for a significant share of GDP, employment, and food security. Yet, these regions often face persistent challenges: low crop yields, inefficient farming practices, vulnerability to climate change, and limited access to markets. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool with the potential to address these issues by enabling data-driven decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and improving resilience against environmental and economic shocks.

However, deploying AI in low-income agricultural contexts is not without challenges. Issues such as limited digital infrastructure, lack of technical expertise, and the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities must be carefully managed. This article explores the role of AI in agricultural development in low-income countries, emphasizing both its transformative potential and the governance frameworks needed to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes.

## The Role of AI in Agricultural Productivity

### Precision Agriculture: Optimizing Resource Use

Precision agriculture, powered by AI, involves the use of sensors, drones, and satellite imagery to collect real-time data on soil, weather, and crop conditions. Machine learning algorithms can analyze this data to provide actionable insights to farmers, such as optimal planting times, irrigation schedules, and fertilizer application rates. For instance, AI models can predict soil moisture levels and recommend precise irrigation, reducing water wastage and improving crop yields.

In low-income countries, pilot programs have already demonstrated the potential of AI-driven precision agriculture. For example, a project in Kenya used AI to analyze soil data and provide fertilizer recommendations via SMS to smallholder farmers. This led to a 15% increase in maize yields and a significant reduction in fertilizer costs. Such interventions are particularly impactful in regions where access to agricultural inputs is limited, and small productivity gains can substantially improve food security.

### Pest and Disease Management

Farmers in low-income countries often lack access to timely information about pest infestations and crop diseases, which can devastate yields. AI-based tools can address this gap by analyzing images of crops to detect early signs of pests or diseases. Mobile applications, such as Plantix and CropIn, are already being used to assist farmers in identifying issues and recommending treatment options.

However, the effectiveness of these tools depends on training AI models with diverse datasets that reflect local crop varieties and conditions. This raises questions about data collection practices and the inclusivity of AI development, which must prioritize the needs of marginalized farmers who are most vulnerable to agricultural shocks.

## Enhancing Food Security with AI

### Predicting and Mitigating Climate Risks

Climate change poses an existential threat to agriculture, particularly in regions prone to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. AI can enhance climate resilience by predicting weather patterns and assessing risks. For example, machine learning models can analyze historical weather data and satellite imagery to forecast droughts months in advance, allowing farmers and governments to take preventative measures.

In Ethiopia, the government has partnered with international organizations to develop AI-driven early warning systems for droughts. These systems have helped allocate resources more efficiently and reduce the impact of food shortages. However, such initiatives require robust public-private partnerships and significant investments in data infrastructure, which are often lacking in low-income countries.

### Supply Chain Optimization

AI can also address inefficiencies in agricultural supply chains, which contribute to high levels of food waste in low-income countries. Machine learning algorithms can predict demand and optimize the distribution of perishable goods, ensuring that surplus produce reaches markets before it spoils. For instance, AI systems have been used in India to streamline the supply chain for fruits and vegetables, reducing post-harvest losses by 20%.

Yet, these solutions often rely on digital connectivity and market access, which remain limited in rural areas. Bridging this gap requires not only technological innovation but also systemic investments in infrastructure and rural development.

## Governance Challenges in AI-Driven Agriculture

### Digital Inequality and Access

One of the most pressing challenges in deploying AI in low-income agricultural contexts is digital inequality. Many smallholder farmers lack access to smartphones, reliable internet, or even electricity, limiting their ability to benefit from AI technologies. Without targeted interventions, there is a risk that AI could exacerbate existing inequalities, leaving marginalized farmers further behind.

Governments and international organizations must prioritize inclusive digital policies, such as subsidizing mobile devices and expanding rural internet access. Initiatives like India's Digital India program, which aims to improve digital literacy and infrastructure in rural areas, offer valuable lessons for other low-income countries.

### Data Sovereignty and Ethical Concerns

The effectiveness of AI in agriculture depends on access to large datasets, including information on soil conditions, weather patterns, and farming practices. However, questions of data ownership and sovereignty are critical, particularly in low-income countries where farmers may not have control over how their data is collected and used. There is a risk that multinational corporations could exploit local data for profit, without adequately compensating the communities that generate it.

To address these concerns, governance frameworks must ensure that data collection is transparent and that farmers retain control over their information. Policies inspired by the principles of [Digital Sovereignty and AI Infrastructure](/research/110-digital-sovereignty-and-ai-infrastructure) could provide a useful starting point for ensuring equitable data governance.

### Capacity Building and Local Expertise

The successful implementation of AI in agriculture requires not only technology but also human capital. Many low-income countries face a shortage of skilled professionals who can develop, deploy, and maintain AI systems. Capacity-building programs, such as training initiatives for local data scientists and agricultural extension workers, are essential.

International collaboration can play a key role here. For example, partnerships between universities in low-income countries and global AI research institutions can help bridge the skills gap. However, such collaborations must be designed to avoid extractive practices, ensuring that local communities retain the benefits of knowledge transfer.

## Case Studies: Successes and Limitations

### Rwanda’s AI-Powered Coffee Sector

Rwanda has successfully integrated AI into its coffee sector, a key export industry. AI tools are used to monitor soil quality, predict yields, and optimize harvesting schedules. These interventions have improved productivity and enabled smallholder farmers to access premium markets. However, the program’s success relied on significant donor funding and public-private partnerships, raising questions about sustainability and scalability.

### Nigeria’s AI-Driven Weather Forecasting

In Nigeria, an AI-powered weather forecasting system has been deployed to provide smallholder farmers with hyper-local weather updates. The system has reduced crop losses due to unexpected weather events and increased farmer incomes. Yet, the program faces challenges in reaching farmers in remote areas with limited digital access, highlighting the importance of infrastructure investments.

## Conclusion

AI holds immense potential to transform agriculture in low-income countries, improving productivity, food security, and economic stability. However, realizing this potential requires addressing significant governance challenges, including digital inequality, data sovereignty, and capacity building. A reflexive approach to AI governance—one that prioritizes inclusivity, transparency, and local empowerment—is essential to ensure that AI benefits all farmers, not just a privileged few.

As AI continues to reshape agriculture, policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders must work collaboratively to create systems that are not only innovative but also equitable and sustainable. The lessons learned from early successes and failures will be critical in guiding the next phase of AI-driven agricultural development.
