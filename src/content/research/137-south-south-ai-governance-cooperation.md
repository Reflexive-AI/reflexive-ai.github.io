## Introduction

AI governance has largely been shaped by global power dynamics, with countries in the Global North—such as the United States, members of the European Union, and China—dominating rule-making and standard-setting processes. However, as artificial intelligence systems become increasingly embedded across economies and societies worldwide, countries in the Global South are beginning to assert their unique perspectives and priorities. This shift raises critical questions about how South-South cooperation can enable more equitable and inclusive AI governance. 

South-South cooperation refers to collaborative efforts among countries in the Global South to address mutual challenges and leverage shared opportunities. Such cooperation in AI governance has the potential to empower these countries, enabling them to shape the global governance landscape while addressing region-specific challenges like technology access, digital equity, and capacity-building. However, significant barriers remain: disparities in technological development, limited resources, and a lack of cohesive strategies across regions. 

This article explores the potential for South-South cooperation in AI governance, focusing on shared challenges, strategic opportunities, and the mechanisms that could support effective collaboration.

## The Case for South-South AI Governance Cooperation

### Shared Challenges and Incentives

Countries in the Global South face common challenges in the adoption and regulation of AI technologies. These include limited digital infrastructure, insufficient local AI expertise, dependency on foreign technology providers, and vulnerabilities to data exploitation. For example, [Data Colonialism: Extraction Patterns in AI Training](/research/136-data-colonialism-extraction-patterns-in-ai-trainin) highlights how low-resource countries often serve as data reservoirs for AI systems developed in the Global North, raising concerns about exploitation and digital sovereignty.

Shared challenges also provide incentives for cooperation. For instance, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are increasingly concerned about the impact of AI-driven automation on labor markets. As detailed in [AI and Job Displacement: What the Evidence Shows](/research/121-ai-and-job-displacement-what-the-evidence-shows), these regions are particularly vulnerable to job losses in manufacturing and agriculture due to automation. Collaborative governance frameworks could enable countries to pool resources for workforce retraining or advocate for global standards that mitigate these risks.

### The Need for Regional Leadership

While the Global North remains dominant in AI development, regions within the Global South, such as Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, are emerging as hubs of innovation and governance experimentation. For instance, India's approach to AI governance, as explored in [India's AI Governance Approach: A Case Study](/research/132-indias-ai-governance-approach-a-case-study), demonstrates how regional leadership can align AI policies with developmental goals. Similarly, Africa's recent efforts to establish a continental AI policy framework reflect growing interest in tackling governance issues collectively.

Regional leadership can amplify the voices of smaller nations and enable them to negotiate more effectively in global forums. By pooling resources and expertise, countries can leverage their collective power to influence international AI governance standards.

## Models and Mechanisms for Cooperation

### Building Regional AI Frameworks

One of the most promising pathways for South-South AI governance cooperation is the development of regional frameworks. These frameworks could harmonize AI policies while allowing flexibility for local adaptation. For example, the African Union's (AU) Digital Transformation Strategy includes proposed guidelines for AI governance, emphasizing digital inclusion, data sovereignty, and ethical AI.

Regional frameworks could also facilitate joint investments in AI infrastructure, addressing gaps identified in [Digital Infrastructure Gaps and AI Readiness](/research/135-digital-infrastructure-gaps-and-ai-readiness). By coordinating investments in data centers, high-speed internet, and computational resources, countries can reduce their reliance on foreign infrastructure and foster local innovation.

### Shared Capacity-Building Initiatives

Capacity-building is another critical area for cooperation. Many countries in the Global South lack the technical and regulatory expertise needed to govern AI effectively. Collaborative programs focusing on education, training, and research can help bridge this gap. For instance, establishing regional AI research institutes or exchange programs could foster knowledge-sharing and skill development.

These initiatives could also address the issue of language bias in AI systems, as explored in [Language Model Bias Against Low-Resource Languages](/research/134-language-model-bias-against-low-resource-languages). By investing in the development of AI models that support local languages and contexts, countries can promote digital inclusion and cultural preservation.

### Establishing Data-Sharing and Governance Pacts

Data governance is central to AI regulation, yet countries in the Global South often face challenges related to data access, privacy, and sovereignty. Establishing South-South data-sharing agreements could enable countries to pool anonymized datasets for AI development while adhering to shared ethical standards.

Such agreements could also help counteract data colonialism by ensuring that local stakeholders retain control over their data. For example, a regional data governance pact in Latin America could establish guidelines for cross-border data flows, ensuring compliance with regional privacy laws while facilitating AI innovation.

## Challenges to South-South Cooperation

### Unequal Capacities Among Partners

One of the primary barriers to South-South cooperation is the disparity in technological and institutional capacities among countries. While nations like India and Brazil have relatively advanced AI ecosystems, many smaller or less-developed countries lack the resources to engage meaningfully in cooperative efforts. This disparity can lead to imbalances in decision-making and resource allocation, undermining the effectiveness of collaborative initiatives.

### Political and Economic Constraints

Political instability, lack of trust among states, and competing national interests can also impede cooperation. For instance, disputes over trade or territorial issues may spill over into technology governance, complicating efforts to establish unified policies. Moreover, economic constraints may limit the ability of some countries to invest in shared infrastructure or initiatives.

### Global Power Dynamics

Finally, South-South cooperation does not exist in a vacuum: it is shaped by the broader context of global power dynamics. Many countries in the Global South remain dependent on technology and funding from the Global North, which can skew governance priorities. For example, international aid programs often emphasize data-sharing agreements that benefit donor countries, perpetuating patterns of digital dependence.

## The Role of International Partnerships

While South-South cooperation is critical, it need not occur in isolation. Partnerships with international organizations, NGOs, and academic institutions can provide additional resources and expertise. For example, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has supported several AI initiatives in the Global South, focusing on capacity-building and ethical AI use.

However, such partnerships must be carefully structured to avoid reinforcing existing inequalities. South-South initiatives should retain leadership roles, ensuring that external partnerships align with regional priorities rather than imposing agendas from the Global North.

## Conclusion

South-South cooperation in AI governance represents a significant opportunity for countries in the Global South to address shared challenges, build capacity, and assert their priorities in the global AI landscape. By developing regional frameworks, investing in capacity-building, and establishing data governance pacts, these countries can foster more equitable and inclusive AI governance. However, achieving this vision will require overcoming significant barriers, including unequal capacities, political constraints, and global power dynamics.

While South-South cooperation is not a panacea, it offers a pathway toward more balanced and context-sensitive AI governance. By working together, countries in the Global South can shape AI policies that reflect their unique needs and aspirations, contributing to a more just and sustainable global AI ecosystem.
