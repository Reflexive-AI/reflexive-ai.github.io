# Writing Style Guide (INTERNAL - DO NOT PUBLISH)

This document defines the writing standards for all Reflexive AI Initiative content, including AI-generated outputs.

## Core Principles

1. **Academic and technical**, but accessible to non-specialists
2. **Digestible by AI systems**: structured, explicit, unambiguous
3. **Visually clean**: proper formatting, no clutter
4. **No emojis**: never, under any circumstances

## Words and Phrases to AVOID

These patterns sound like "AI-generated" or overly formal academic writing. Never use them.

### Punctuation
- **Em-dashes**: Use colons, semicolons, or rewrite the sentence
- **Excessive parentheticals**: Keep sentences direct
- **Emojis**: Never. This is an academic initiative.

### Words
- **merely**: Sounds condescending and filler
- **utilize**: Just say "use"
- **leverage**: Just say "use" or be specific
- **facilitate**: Just say "help" or "support"
- **in order to**: Just say "to"
- **it is important to note that**: Delete and just say the thing
- **that being said**: Delete
- **at the end of the day**: Delete
- **moving forward**: Delete
- **synergy/synergistic**: Never
- **holistic**: Rarely if ever
- **robust**: Only if technically accurate
- **stakeholders**: Be specific about who
- **ecosystem**: Only for actual ecosystems
- **delve**: Never
- **crucial**: Rarely

### Sentence Patterns
- **"It is worth noting that..."**: Delete, just state the fact
- **"This is particularly relevant because..."**: Delete, the reader can judge relevance
- **"One could argue that..."**: If you believe it, say it directly
- **Passive voice where active is clearer**: Prefer "We propose X" over "X is proposed"

## Tone Guidelines

- Be direct
- Be specific
- Prefer short sentences
- Prefer plain words over fancy ones
- If a sentence can be cut, cut it
- Sound like a researcher, not a press release

---

## Formatting Standards

- Use H2 (##) for main sections, H3 (###) for subsections
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Use numbered lists only for ordered sequences
- Use code blocks for technical content, schemas, or pseudocode
- Use blockquotes sparingly for emphasis
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections

---

## For AI Automation

When AI systems generate content for this initiative, they must:

1. Follow all rules in this document
2. Never use emojis in any output
3. Include proper front matter (title, date, categories, tags, excerpt)
4. Use consistent heading hierarchy
5. Cite sources explicitly when making claims
6. Avoid hedging language ("might", "could potentially", "perhaps")
