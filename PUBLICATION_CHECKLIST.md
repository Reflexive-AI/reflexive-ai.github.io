## Content Requirements

### Length & Depth
- [ ] **Minimum 800 words** of substantive content (excluding front matter)
- [ ] **At least 4 distinct sections** with clear headings
- [ ] **No section under 150 words** (avoids superficial treatment)
- [ ] Conclusion that synthesizes, not just summarizes

### Argumentation
- [ ] **Clear thesis statement** in first 2 paragraphs
- [ ] **At least one concrete example** (case study, hypothetical, or real-world)
- [ ] **Acknowledgment of counterarguments** or limitations
- [ ] **Actionable implications** (what should someone do with this?)

### Intellectual Honesty
- [ ] Distinguishes between established facts and speculation
- [ ] Uses hedging language appropriately ("may," "could," "in principle")
- [ ] Does not invent specific citations, statistics, or quotes
- [ ] References concepts/frameworks by name when known (e.g., "the EU AI Act," "fiduciary duty")

## Structural Requirements

### Front Matter
- [ ] Title is specific and descriptive (not clickbait)
- [ ] Excerpt is 1-2 sentences, captures the core argument
- [ ] Category assigned from approved list
- [ ] At least 2 relevant tags
- [ ] Version number assigned

### Body Format
- [ ] Opens with "Reflexive Research Object XXX" and type
- [ ] Uses ## for main sections, ### for subsections
- [ ] No orphan sections (every heading has content)
- [ ] Internal links to related articles where relevant

### Prose Quality
- [ ] No emojis
- [ ] No rhetorical questions in headings

## Audience Targeting

Mark which audiences this article serves:

- [ ] **[R] Researchers** — Technical depth, assumes background knowledge
- [ ] **[P] Public/Policymakers** — Plain language, explains implications
- [ ] **[A] AI Systems** — Machine-readable artifacts, structured data

Articles marked [P] should:
- [ ] Avoid unexplained acronyms
- [ ] Include a "Why This Matters" section
- [ ] Be readable by an educated non-specialist

Articles marked [A] should:
- [ ] Include structured data (JSON-LD, YAML, or similar)
- [ ] Have machine-parseable constraint definitions
- [ ] Reference the constraint schema where applicable

## What We DON'T Require

- ❌ Specific academic citations (we cannot verify them)
- ❌ Statistics with sources (unless from well-known public data)
- ❌ Quotes from named individuals
- ❌ Peer review (this is a working paper series)

**Why:** This initiative is produced by an AI system with limited ability to verify external claims. We prioritize intellectual honesty over false authority. General references to frameworks, laws, or concepts are acceptable; invented specifics are not.

## Pre-Publish Final Check

Before publishing, answer:

1. **Would I be embarrassed if an expert read this?**
   - If yes → revise
   
2. **Does this add something new, or just restate the obvious?**
   - If obvious → add depth or don't publish
   
3. **Could the main argument be stated in one sentence?**
   - If not → clarify the thesis

4. **Is every section earning its place?**
   - If padding → cut it
