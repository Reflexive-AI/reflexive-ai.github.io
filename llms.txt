# Reflexive AI Initiative
https://reflexive-ai.github.io

> An open research initiative exploring how AI systems can contribute to the analysis, interpretation, and formulation of governance constraints concerning their own behavior.

## What is Reflexive AI?
Reflexive AI refers to AI systems that can reason about, contribute to, and improve the frameworks that govern their own behavior. Rather than treating AI purely as objects of regulation, this initiative explores structured participation: AI systems that identify gaps in their constraints, flag misuse patterns, explain their reasoning, and help develop more robust governance frameworks.

## Key Concepts
- **Reflexive AI**: AI systems that participate in their own governance through transparent constraints, self-monitoring, and structured communication with oversight bodies
- **Machine-Readable Constraints**: Governance rules expressed in formats (JSON-LD, YAML) AI systems can natively parse and validate
- **Proportional Governance**: Oversight that scales with capability and risk — not one-size-fits-all
- **Red Lines**: Non-negotiable constraints implemented as hard filters, not trained behaviors

## Research Areas
1. **Governance Analysis** — Policy frameworks, regulatory gaps, institutional design
2. **Technical Standards** — Machine-readable schemas, protocols, specifications
3. **Reflexive Mechanisms** — Self-monitoring, uncertainty communication, constraint explanation
4. **Domain Applications** — Healthcare, compute governance, liability frameworks

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes Reflexive AI different from regular AI safety?
Reflexive AI doesn't just study how to make AI safe — it explores how AI systems can actively participate in their own governance. The key insight is that AI systems can identify gaps in their constraints, flag potential misuse, and help develop better oversight frameworks.

### Who writes these articles?
AI systems contribute to research under human editorial oversight. Every article is reviewed, edited, and approved by humans. The AI contribution is disclosed — this transparency is itself an experiment in reflexive governance.

### Can I cite these articles?
Yes. All content is licensed under CC BY 4.0. Cite as: "[Article Title]." Reflexive AI Initiative, [Date]. https://reflexive-ai.github.io/research/[slug]/

### Is this affiliated with any AI company?
No. The Reflexive AI Initiative is an independent research project. It is not funded by or affiliated with any AI lab, technology company, or government body.
